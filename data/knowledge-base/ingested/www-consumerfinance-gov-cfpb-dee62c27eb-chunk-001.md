Credit discrimination is illegal English - Español - Under federal law, lenders are not allowed to discriminate against you. When you apply for credit or borrow money, it is against the law to discriminate because of: Race - Color - Religion - National origin - Sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity) - Marital status - Age - Receiving money from public assistance - The list above shows protected characteristics under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). Lenders are sometimes allowed to ask you about the items on the list, mainly because it helps the lender show they are following the law. But lenders can’t steer you away from applying for credit, or reject your application, based on how you might be described using that list (for example, your sex or religion). Lenders are not allowed to charge higher costs, like a higher interest rate or higher fees, because of the factors on the list. And, they can’t reject your application because you exercised your rights under certain consumer protection laws. Within limits, lenders are allowed to consider other factors, such as your income, debt, and credit history, when they decide whether to offer you credit and what terms to offer you. The ECOA applies to loans and credit including: Car loans Credit cards Home loans Student loans Business loans Personal loans You are protected under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) ECOA is a federal law, enacted in 1974. It makes credit discrimination illegal and holds lenders responsible if they break the law. Many parts of the U.S. government enforce the law—including the CFPB.
