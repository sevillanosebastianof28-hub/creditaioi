Bundling your auto, home, and life insurance can lead to significant savings and streamlined management. Most American drivers start out using the same insurance company their parents had and they never really think to switch. Many first-time homeowners get their homeowners insurance in the same way. It's probably the company their real estate agent or title company recommended. Life insurance purchases usually follow a similar path. People buy insurance based on convenience as well as initial price. A lot of people end up with a hodgepodge of insurance carriers as a result.

Of course, these rates depend on where you live, the value of your home and car(s), driving habits, personal health, and so forth. Consider the Pros and Cons of Insurance Bundling For just one line of insurance, most large companies aren't extremely price-competitive. After all, those thousands of people on staff can really add up. By combining your policies under one roof, the companies benefit from economies of scale and can justify more discounts. As for life insurance, people who have a life insurance policy are much less likely to switch insurance carriers because of the difficulty (or even
