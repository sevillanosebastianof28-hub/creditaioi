of CDs: Traditional CD: With a traditional CD, you'll likely have a set term and fixed interest rate. After making an initial deposit, your money will earn interest until the account matures. You typically can't deposit moreâand your money is locked into the CD until the term ends. Tapping your funds early will likely result in an early withdrawal penalty. - No-penalty CD: These CDs, which are sometimes called liquid CDs, allow you to withdraw money early without being penalized. That can be a nice benefit, but traditional CDs usually offer better APYs. - Bump-up CD: With this type of CD, you can request an interest rate increase. You can usually take advantage of this perk just once during your CD's termâand it can come in handy if rates increase after you're locked into your CD. However, initial APYs usually lag behind traditional CDs. - Step-up CD: This is similar to a bump-up CD, but instead of requesting a one-time increase, the rate will automatically go up at predetermined intervals. Step-up CDs usually start at a lower rate than a traditional CD, and the APY may be variable. That could be a benefit or a drawback, depending on interest rate trends. - IRA CD: IRA CDs are held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs). That can allow you to take advantage of high interest rates and certain tax benefits. Traditional IRAs, for example, offer tax-deferred growth. That means you won't owe taxes until you make withdrawals in retirement. One downside of an IRA CD is that you could face hefty early withdrawal penalties if you pull out your money before the term ends. - Brokered CD: You can only purchase brokered CDs from a broker or brokerage firm. That could get you a higher rate. It's also possible to hold several CDs within one brokerage account. Another benefit is that you might be able to tap your funds ahead of the maturity date without paying a fee. However, many brokered CDs are callable. That means the issuer could end the term early if they want to. - Jumbo CD: These typically offer a high interest rate, but be prepared to make a large opening deposit. Most jumbo CDs require at least $100,000 to get started. The upside is that money could earn a lot of interest during the CD term. - Learn more: How to Choose the Best CD Account Pros and Cons of CDs In addition to their benefits, CDs have certain drawbacks to consider before opening an account.
