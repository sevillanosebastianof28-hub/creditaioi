Hello, how can we help? What should I do if I’ve lost important financial documents after a natural disaster or national emergency? My house was destroyed by a natural disaster and I can’t make my credit card payments. What should I do? Will I need to contact lenders and creditors if I've been impacted by a natural disaster? What should I do first when I’ve been impacted by a natural disaster or national emergency?
