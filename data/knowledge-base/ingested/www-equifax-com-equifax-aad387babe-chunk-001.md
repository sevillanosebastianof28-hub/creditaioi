Learn how best to navigate wage garnishment in case it happens to you. What is wage garnishment? Wage garnishment is a method of debt collection in which part of your earnings are withheld each pay period and used to pay back your creditors. Wage garnishment can affect both private debts, such as a delinquent loan or credit card bill, and public debt, such as taxes owed to the government. Wage garnishment is a legal process that usually requires a creditor to sue you for unpaid private debt. However, there are exceptions for certain public debts where the government may garnish your wages without first taking you to court. The duration of the garnishment depends on your situation. Often, your wages are garnished until your debt is settled. Who can garnish wages? Any private creditor can seek a court order to garnish your wages. This includes credit card companies, banks, mortgage companies and debt collection agencies. Garnishment can also occur when you miss alimony or child support payments. Additionally, federal, state and local governments can garnish your wages for back taxes and unpaid student loans. These kinds of public debts usually don’t require a lawsuit or a court order to trigger garnishment. How much of your wages can be garnished? If your wages are garnished, federal law extends you certain legal protections under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. It limits how much of your take-home pay can be garnished, based on the size of your earnings and the type of debt you owe. For private debt, garnishment in a single pay period is limited to 25% of your take-home pay or the amount by which your take-home pay is greater than 30 times the federal minimum wage, whichever is less. If your take-home pay is 30 times the federal minimum wage or less, your income is exempt from garnishment. The amount of your take-home pay that can be garnished is higher for alimony and child support — between 50% and 65% depending on your circumstances. For federal student loans, garnishment is limited to 15% of your take-home pay. And for back taxes, the IRS calculates garnishment based on the standard deduction and the number of dependents you have. State governments can place additional restrictions on garnishment, providing they don’t conflict with federal regulations. And some federal or state benefits, like Social Security, are completely exempt. How to stop wage garnishment It’s difficult — but not impossible — to stop wage garnishment once a court order has been issued. First, try making arrangements with your creditor for a repayment plan. Creditors and debt collection agencies are often willing to work out repayment agreements to avoid further legal expense and hassle. At the same time, seek legal help, preferably from an attorney who specializes in consumer protection or debt collection law. Depending on the type of debt you owe, the legal window to challenge wage garnishment can be small. If negotiation with your creditor fails, you’ll need to act fast. Legal proceedings vary by state and type of debt, but you may be able to file an exemption claim with the court. For example, in most states, a head of household may qualify for an exemption. Similarly, if you believe your wages are being
