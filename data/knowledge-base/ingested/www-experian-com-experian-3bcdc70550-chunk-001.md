Cash Back vs. Points: Which Rewards Credit Card Is Better? Quick Answer Cash back is usually the simplest and most flexible rewards credit card option, but points may offer higher value if youâre strategic. The better choice depends on your spending habits and how much effort you want to put into maximizing rewards. When you're choosing a rewards credit card, one of the biggest decisions you'll face is whether to earn cash back or points. Both cash back and points can be great options, but which is best for you depends on your specific needs and preferences. To help you decide, here's a quick comparison: Cash Back | Points | ---|---| Ease of use | Simple and straightforward; redeem for statement credits, direct deposits or gift cards | More complex; redemption options and values vary by card and program | ---|---|---| Redemption value | Fixed value | Variable value; may be worth more than cash back when transferred to partners | ---|---|---| Annual fee | Often $0, though some cards may charge fees | Frequently charge annual fees, especially among travel cards | ---|---|---| Best for | Everyday purchases and simple rewards | Travelers and those willing to strategize redemptions for maximum value | ---|---|---| How Does Cash Back Work? Cash back credit cards reward you with a percentage of your spending returned to you as cash. When you make a purchase, you earn a certain percentage backâtypically ranging from 1% to 6% depending on the purchase category and card. The mechanics are straightforward: You use your card to make purchases, and the card issuer calculates your cash back based on your spending. Some cards offer a flat rate on all purchases, while others provide higher rates in specific categories like groceries, gas or dining. Certain cards rotate their bonus categories quarterly, requiring you to activate them to earn the higher rate. Once you've earned cash back, you can redeem it in several ways. Most issuers let you apply it as a statement credit to reduce your balance, deposit it directly into a bank account or use it for purchases at checkout. Some may also offer other redemption options, such as gift cards, shopping or online travel.
