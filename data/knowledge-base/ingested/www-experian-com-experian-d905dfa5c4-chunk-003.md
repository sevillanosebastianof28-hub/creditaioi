for essential bills and set spending alerts to ensure you don't overdraw your checking account. Tip: The no-budget budget generally works best if you have a steady income and don't tend to overspend. It's less effective if you're an impulse buyer or have an irregular income. Why Is Budgeting Important? Budgeting is important because it helps you make the most of your money and reach your financial goals. Sticking to your budget ensures you can cover your bills and pay your debts. Budgeting can also help you reach short- and long-term financial goals like taking a vacation or buying a home. Without a budget, you're more likely to overdraw your bank account or overspend on your credit cards. You might get hit with late payment or overdraft fees or accumulate interest on your credit card balance, which can lead to a cycle of debt. Budgeting eases financial stress because you know your critical expenses are handled. If you're struggling with high-interest debt, budgeting can help you pay it off. For example, you could use the snowball method or avalanche method to budget for paying down credit cards. Tip: Make room in your budget to build an emergency fund you can tap for financial crises or unexpected expenses, like layoffs or a big medical bill. How to Make a Budget To make a budget, follow these steps. 1. Add Up Your Expenses Review your spending over the past three to six months by looking at your bank account and credit card statements. Many bank or credit card apps can automatically sort your spending into categories; you can also use spreadsheet software to categorize spending. Depending on the budgeting method you plan to use, you can use broad categories, such as utilities, or more detailed categories, such as breaking utilities into gas, water, electricity, internet service and so on.

Calculate Your Income Add up all your sources of income, including paychecks and money from tips, side gigs, unemployment compensation, Social Security or other sources. This is generally straightforward if you receive a regular income. If your income fluctuates, review the past year's net income and divide it by 12 to get an average monthly income. 3. Set Financial Goals Think of realistic ideas for improving your financial life. Your goals should be achievable given your current financial situation but also help you get where you want to go. For example, if you're living paycheck-to-paycheck, you could set a financial goal to break the cycle by reducing spending and putting a set amount into an emergency fund each week. Once you escape the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, you can set new goals like paying down debt faster or saving for a down payment on a new car. Learn more: How to Set SMART Financial Goals 4. Choose a Budgeting Method Decide how you want to structure your budget using the different methods described above. If this is your first time making a budget, a flexible option like the 50/30/20 plan can be a good place to start. 5. Track Your Spending Track your spending to see whether your budget is working. You can track spending on paper or with a spreadsheet, but the easiest option is to download a budgeting app that automatically syncs to your bank account. That way, you can import and categorize transactions and chart your progress over time. Learn more: How to Track Your Expenses 6. Adjust Your Budget as Needed Regularly review your spending and compare it to your budget. You can do this each month, each pay period or each week, whichever works best for you.
