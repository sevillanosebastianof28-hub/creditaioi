Personal Loan Calculator Before taking out a personal loan, you'll want to compare your options and figure out which loan will be best for you. This personal loan calculator can help you estimate your monthly payments based on a few pieces of information. You can then change the loan amount, interest rate or repayment term to see how a different loan might be better or worse for your situation. How to Use This Calculator The personal loan calculator estimates your monthly payment and provides a payment schedule based on a few potential loan terms. Here's how to use it: Enter your desired loan amount. Depending on the lender, you may be able to borrow anywhere from $250 to $100,000. Note that some lenders deduct an origination fee before disbursing your funds, so you may need to borrow slightly more than you actually need. - Estimate your interest rate. Personal loan interest rates typically range from 7% to 36%, with your assigned rate based on your creditworthiness. Borrowers with higher credit scores tend to qualify for the best terms. - Provide your desired repayment term. Personal loan repayment terms often range from one to seven years, though some lenders may offer less flexibility. - Calculate your payment. Click on the "Calculate" button to get an estimate of your monthly payment, how much interest you'll pay over the life of the loan and a detailed repayment schedule. - Compare personal loan rates Find APRs from 4.99% to 35.99% and flexible terms of 12 to 120 months. Loan amounts range from $1,000 up to $250,000, with funding available the same day or up to 7 days.

How to Compare Personal Loans Before choosing a personal loan, it's important to look beyond the monthly payment and consider the full cost of borrowing. Experian's personal loan calculator can make it easier for you to compare multiple offers and make a more informed decision. Here are some tips to help you compare personal loan offers: Look at the total cost. A lower monthly payment might seem attractive, but it may mean you're paying more interest over time. The total interest cost gives you the full picture of how much you'll pay in the long run. - Focus on the annual percentage rate (APR). The APR includes the interest rate and most fees, giving you a more accurate view of the loan's true cost. - Consider loan term length. Longer terms lower your monthly payments but increase the total interest cost. On the flip side, a shorter loan term can help minimize your interest costs, but it'll result in a higher monthly payment. Carefully consider your options to determine the right term length for your situation. - Watch out for fees. Some lenders charge origination fees that can affect the total loan cost. These fees directly affect how much of the loan amount you actually receive. - As you evaluate offers, ask yourself whether the monthly payment or total cost is more important to you. If your priority is keeping your budget flexible, a lower monthly payment might make sense. But if you can afford a higher payment, choosing the loan with the lowest total cost can save you hundredsâor even thousandsâof dollars over time. Here's an example of two hypothetical scenarios for someone looking to borrow $10,000: Terms | Loan A | Loan B | ---|---|---| Loan amount | $10,000 | $10,000 | ---|---|---| Interest rate | 10% | 13% | ---|---|---| Repayment term | 3 years | 5 years | ---|---|---| Monthly payment | $322.67 | $227.53 | ---|---|---| Total interest paid | $1,616.19 | $3,651.84 | ---|---|---| How to Apply for a Personal Loan Applying
