and fuelâbelow 10% to 20% of your monthly take-home pay. You'll also want to plan for a down payment of at least 10%, which can help you qualify for better loan terms and reduce your monthly payments. Learn more: How Much Is a Down Payment on a Car? 2. Research Vehicles Think about the features that matter most to you, such as fuel efficiency, cargo space, safety ratings and reliability. Online resources like Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book and Consumer Reports can help you compare different makes and models based on your priorities. Consider the vehicle's age and mileage as well. While older cars with higher mileage typically cost less, they may require more frequent maintenance and repairs down the road. 3. Research the Price Once you've found a vehicle you're interested in, use pricing guides like Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds or J.D. Power to estimate its fair market value. You'll need the VIN or details such as the year, make, model, trim, mileage and condition. Compare the dealer's asking price against similar vehicles in your area. This research gives you leverage when it's time to negotiate. 4. Check Your Credit Your credit score plays a significant role in the interest rate you'll receive on an auto loan. Before you start shopping, check your credit report and FICOÂ® ScoreÎ so you know where you stand. If your credit needs improvement, you may want to take some time to pay down existing debt or address any errors on your credit report before applying for financing.

You'll know exactly how much you can borrow and at what rate, which helps you stay within your budget. You can apply for preapproval through your bank, credit union or online lenders. Whatever you do, be sure to compare offers from multiple lenders to find the best terms. 6. Inspect the Car Even though dealerships typically inspect and recondition used vehicles before selling them, it's wise to conduct your own evaluation. Walk around the exterior and interior, checking for any cosmetic damage or mechanical issues. For added peace of mind, consider paying for an independent pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic. This typically costs between $100 and $200 but can reveal hidden problems that might cost you much more later. 7. Take a Test Drive A test drive is essential for evaluating how the car feels on the road. Drive on a mix of city streets and highways to assess acceleration, braking, handling and noise levels. Pay attention to how the steering responds, whether the brakes feel firm and if there are any unusual sounds like rattling, whining or grinding. Test the air conditioning, heating and all electronic features during the drive. 8. Review the Vehicle History Report Ask the dealer for a copy of the vehicle history report or purchase one yourself using the VIN. Look for red flags like multiple accidents, a salvage title, flood damage or inconsistent odometer readings. A clean title and single-owner history are generally positive signs. Be especially cautious of vehicles that have changed hands frequently or were previously used as rental cars or taxis, as it could cause additional wear on the car. 9. Negotiate the Price With no manufacturer's suggested retail price on used cars, there's often room to negotiate. Use your researchâincluding the vehicle's estimated value, comparable listings and any issues found during the inspectionâto support your offer. Be prepared to walk away if the dealer won't meet a price you're comfortable with. If you have a vehicle to trade in, research its trade-in value separately so you can negotiate each transaction independently. Learn more: How to Negotiate the Price of a Car 10. Finalize the
