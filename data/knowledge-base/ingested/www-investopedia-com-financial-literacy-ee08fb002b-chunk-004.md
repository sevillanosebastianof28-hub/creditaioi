Additionally, it allows you to convert your term policy to permanent insurance without a medical exam, and this option is included at no extra cost. Pros & Cons Pros Budget-friendly term insurance premiums Helpful online features and tools Few customer complaints Cons Doesn’t offer universal or variable universal life insurance Whole life dividend rate is low Overview For term life insurance at an affordable price, it’s hard to beat SBLI. It provided some of the lowest premiums Investopedia found when gathering quotes from 45 companies. You can obtain an individualized quote, apply for a term policy, and chat with a live representative all through the website. Customers seem happy with SBLI, lodging relatively few complaints with state regulators compared to the company’s size. These qualities make SBLI great for cheap term insurance, but it’s not the best for permanent life insurance. SBLI doesn’t offer universal or variable universal life insurance, and the dividend rate for its whole life insurance is low. Investopedia also found the company’s rider selection to be on the skimpy side. SBLI’s headquarters are in Woburn, Massachusetts, and it was founded in 1907.

Death benefits can run as small as $25,000 and have virtually no top limit. You’ll find a lot of riders to choose from, including a child term rider available for UL policies. Pros & Cons Pros Offers every main type of universal life insurance Death benefits have no maximum limits Customer complaints are few relative to company size Cons No online quotes or applications Doesn’t offer whole life insurance Overview Pacific Life is one of the few companies that sell universal life, indexed universal life insurance (IUL), and variable universal life insurance (VUL). Nationwide, Prudential, and John Hancock do as well, but they don’t offer as many different policy options for each type. In some markets, Pacific Life features two UL, four IUL, and five VUL products. But these products are complex, and Pacific Life doesn’t let you apply online. You’ll have to talk with an agent by phone or in person. Furthermore, the company does not sell whole life insurance. Based in Newport Beach, California, Pacific Life was founded in 1868.
