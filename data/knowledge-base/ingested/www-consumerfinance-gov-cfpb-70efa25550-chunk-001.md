Competition and innovation at CFPB Our mission is to promote competition and innovation that benefits consumers in the financial products and services market. We aim to fulfill this statutory mandate by: Identifying structural problems that block new competitors from entering the market - Using data to strengthen competition and gauge how market innovation impacts consumers - Working with stakeholders to identify and challenge existing market structures that harm consumers - Coordinating with Federal, State, and international regulators on matters related to competition and innovation - Stay informed about our regulatory coordination The CFPB partners with other financial regulators across the nation and around the world to foster a competitive and innovative environment for consumer financial products and services. American Consumer Financial Innovation Network The American Consumer Financial Innovation Network (ACFIN) helps Federal and State officials coordinate efforts to facilitate innovation and further objectives such as consumer access, competition, and financial inclusion. The network also seeks to help regulators keep pace with innovation to help ensure consumer financial services markets are free from fraud, discrimination, and deceptive practices. Join ACFIN (for Federal and State officials and regulators) Global Financial Innovation Network The Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) seeks to provide a more efficient way for companies to interact with regulators as they look to scale new ideas. GFIN is also looking to create a new framework of cooperation among financial services regulators around the world.
