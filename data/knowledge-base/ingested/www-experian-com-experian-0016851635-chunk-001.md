What Is a Secured Credit Card? Quick Answer A secured credit card requires a security deposit, which reduces risk for card issuers. This makes secured cards easier to get than unsecured cards if you have poor or no credit, and can help you build or improve credit with responsible use. A secured credit card is a type of card that requires a security deposit, which typically becomes your credit limit. If you stop making payments, the card issuer can take money from your security deposit to cover what you owe. Secured credit cards can be used just like traditionalâunsecuredâcredit cards, but are easier to get if you have poor credit or a limited credit history. Using a secured credit card responsibly can also help improve your credit score. How Does a Secured Credit Card Work? You can make purchases with a secured credit card just as you would with a regular, unsecured credit card. The difference: The card is secured by a deposit you make when you open the account. If you default on your payments, the card issuer can use your security deposit to pay the card balance. The deposit reduces risk for the card issuer, which can make it easier to get approved for a secured credit card even if you have poor credit or no credit history. Here's a closer look at how secured credit cards work. Security deposit: To open a secured credit card, you make a refundable deposit that serves as collateral. The required security deposit typically starts at $200, but you may have the option to make a larger or smaller deposit. If you default on your credit card balance, the card issuer can use the deposit to pay themselves back. If you make timely payments, you'll generally get your deposit back when the card converts to an unsecured card or when you close the account. - Credit limit: The credit limit is the maximum amount you can spend on your credit card and is usually equal to the amount of your security deposit. You may be able to increase your credit limit by adding to your initial security deposit or by making a certain number of on-time payments. - Billing cycle: You're billed for your credit card purchases on a monthly cycle. When payment is due, you can opt to pay all or part of your balance, but you must make at least the minimum monthly payment required. - Carrying a balance: Any balance you don't pay by the card's payment due date carries over to the following month and accrues interest at the card's annual percentage rate (APR). - Tip: You can't use your security deposit to pay your secured credit card bill. You'll need to make at least the minimum payment on time or risk damage to your credit scores. Secured vs. Unsecured Credit Card Secured and unsecured credit cards are both revolving credit and essentially work the same way. But there are some important differences, including the security deposit requirement, how your credit limit is determined and how easy it is to qualify for a card.
