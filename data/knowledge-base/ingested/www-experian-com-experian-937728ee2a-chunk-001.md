APR vs. Interest Rate: Whatâs the Difference? Quick Answer Annual percentage rate (APR) and interest rate both tell borrowers the cost to borrow, and both are represented as a percentage of the amount borrowed. However, a loanâs interest rate doesnât include loan fees, while its APR tells you the full cost youâll pay to borrow on an annual basis, including fees. Getting a loan typically means paying interestâit's the cost of borrowing money. And shopping for the least expensive loan or credit card option involves comparing the cost to borrow among various lenders. But if you simply look at the interest rate, are you truly making an accurate comparison? Not necessarily. While you may sometimes see them used interchangeably, the key difference between an interest rate and annual percentage rate (APR) is that APR represents not only the debt product's interest rate, but also any additional fees and costs associated with it. That makes APR the more revealing number to look at when you need an apples-to-apples comparison of two offers. The only exception is credit cards: With these, interest rate and APR are the same thing. Here's what you need to know about the differences between interest rates and APRs. Interest Rate | APR | ---|---| Definition | The cost of borrowing expressed as a percentage | The total cost of borrowing, including interest and fees, expressed as an annualized rate | ---|---|---| Includes fees? | No | Yes | ---|---|---| Can be fixed or variable? | Yes | Yes | ---|---|---| Purpose | Shows the base cost of the loan | Gives a more complete picture of the loan's true cost | ---|---|---| Helps compare loans? | Not always, since fees vary | Yes, more accurate for comparing loan offers | ---|---|---| What Is Interest? Interest is the cost a borrower pays to borrow money. You'll usually see it expressed as a percentage of the amount borrowed. Whatever type of loan you're getting âwhether it's an installment loan such as a mortgage, auto loan, student loan or personal loan, or revolving credit such as a credit cardâyou'll typically pay interest on your balance until it's fully repaid.

Example: If you borrowed $30,000 to buy a car at an interest rate of 8% over 60 months, you would pay a total of $6,498 over the life of the loan. Calculating interest on a credit card can be a little more complicated. Credit card interest is charged based on your average daily balance and the daily interest rate, which is your card's annual rate divided by 365 (the number of days in a year). To make this easier, you can use a credit card payoff calculator to figure out your interest charges. Tip: The interest rates you receive when you apply to borrow money depend on your creditworthiness and other factors such as income. Interest is also impacted by market conditions and by benchmark rates influenced by the Federal Reserve.
