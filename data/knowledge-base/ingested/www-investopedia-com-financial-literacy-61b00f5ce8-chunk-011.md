A personal loan is a type of installment loan where borrowers receive a lump sum and then repay it in increments over a period of time. Personal loan amounts can range from a few hundred dollars to $100,000. The repayment terms may also vary: some can be paid off in a few months while others may be repaid over years. Personal loans can be unsecured or secured, although most are unsecured. Secured loans require the borrower to provide collateral to back the loan, while unsecured loans don’t. Since unsecured loans don’t require collateral, lenders typically determine the terms of your loan by evaluating your creditworthiness—the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to receive favorable terms, including a lower APR. Lenders may also examine your annual income, credit history, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Typically, the interest rate, or Annual Percentage Rate (APR), on personal loans is fixed, which means it doesn’t fluctuate.

Origination fees are represented as a percentage of the total loan amount, typically ranging from 1% to 8%. They are included in the APR. Since these are upfront fees are often deducted before you begin making payments, subtract the origination fee from the total loan amount to calculate the funds you’ll receive. Credit Score: A credit score is a three-digit number that indicates a borrower’s creditworthiness. Credit scores are calculated by evaluating factors like someone’s payment history, length of credit history, and credit utilization. Lenders will look at a borrower’s credit score to approve someone for a loan and determine the terms of the loan.
