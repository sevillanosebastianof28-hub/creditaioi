With debt settlement, you negotiate with your creditors to pay less than what you owe. You can try doing it yourself, or you can hire a debt settlement company to do it for a fee. Debt Consolidation | Debt Settlement | ---|---| Involves paying off one or more existing debts with a new loan or credit card | Involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than what you owe | Typically requires good or excellent credit | No minimum credit score requirement | May slightly damage your credit at first, but can help build credit over time | Can cause long-lasting damage to your credit | Best for people looking to save on interest and pay down debt faster | Best for people significantly behind on debt payments | Because your payment history is the most important factor in your credit score, settling your debt for less than what you owe can have major negative consequences for your credit score. On top of that, debt settlement companies typically have you stop making payments on your debts while saving up for the settlement amount, which can cause your credit scores to plummet even further. In contrast, debt consolidation can have an impact on your credit score when you apply and open a new loan or credit card. But as long as you make your payments on time, there likely won't be any long-term damage. In fact, if it helps you avoid late payments and you pay the loan as agreed, debt consolidation can help improve your credit.

While you can technically qualify for a personal loan with fair or even bad credit, you may have a hard time qualifying for an interest rate that's low enough to help you save money. As for balance transfer credit cards, most of them require a good credit score or better to get approved. According to FICO, that typically starts at 670, but credit card issuers may have their own minimum score requirements. Does Debt Consolidation Hurt Your Credit? Consolidating your debt can cause a slight temporary decrease in your credit score. This is largely due to the hard inquiry the lender makes when you apply for credit and the new credit account, which reduces your average age of accounts. If you get a balance transfer credit card, your credit could also dip if the transfer results in a high credit utilization rate on your new card. As you pay down the balance, however, your credit score will likely improve. If you use a consolidation loan to pay off credit card debt, your utilization rate won't be a factor since credit scoring models only consider utilization of revolving credit (such as credit cards). In fact, reducing your utilization rate on your credit cards to 0% can potentially help your credit score.
