Support Open Access to Law Over 40 million people rely on the Legal Information Institute [LII] each year to find and understand the laws that govern them. Your one-time or monthly gift will directly support the small staff and computing facilities we require to make law free and open for everyone. On behalf of all those who wish to know their rights and responsibilities under the law, thanks for your support! " Thank you so much for making the law accessible. It should not be the special and exclusive preserve of lawyers or businesses able to afford to pay for access. This is a vital service in our democracy. I'm happy and grateful to continue to support you." Frequently asked questions Is my donation secure? Do I get a receipt? What does my donation support? Is my donation tax-deductible? How do I send a check? Can I use PayPal? Myron Taylor Hall Ithaca, NY 14853
