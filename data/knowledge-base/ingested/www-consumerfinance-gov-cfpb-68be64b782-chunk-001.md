Amicus program The CFPB is responsible for implementing many federal laws that relate to consumer finance. Courts sometimes apply those same laws to resolve disputes between private parties. In some cases, we believe a court would benefit from hearing our views on what the law says. The amicus program is how we share our views with to the court. (“Amicus” is shorthand for “Amicus curiae”, Latin for “friend of the court.”) Our amicus briefs provide the courts with the CFPB’s views on significant consumer financial protection issues and help ensure that consumer financial protection statutes and regulations are correctly and consistently interpreted. Recently filed amicus briefs Roberts v. Unlock Partnership Solutions AOI, Inc. Salom et al. v. Nationstar Mortgage LLC Jose Lopez v. Bank of Orrick, et al. New York v. Citibank, N.A. Suggest a case We welcome your suggestions of cases that might make good candidates for the amicus program.
