months could help you in the long run if CD rates decline in the next year or two. CD rates are higher in 2024 than they have been in 20 years. So yes, now is a good time to buy a CD. What Is a Jumbo CD? A CD with a minimum deposit requirement of $100,000 or more is usually considered a jumbo CD. While the required minimum deposit is higher than traditional CDs, the interest rates on jumbos are not always higher. That means you could earn a higher interest rate by depositing $100,000 in a traditional CD instead of a jumbo CD. Just shop around to learn which CD is best for your money and situation.
