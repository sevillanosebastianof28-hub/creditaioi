Learn about our Financial Review Board Close Cost and Freight vs. Cost, Insurance, and Freight: An Overview Cost and freight (CFR) is a trade term that requires the seller to transport goods by sea to a required port. It includes costs excluding insurance. Cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) is what a seller pays to cover the cost of shipping, as well as the insurance to protect against the potential damage of loss to a buyer's order. The two are part of a larger group of international trade rules known as Incoterms. These global guidelines for traders were devised by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), with the first version published in 1936. Each term refers to an agreement governing the responsibilities of shipping that fall respectively to buyers and sellers in an international trade transaction. This system of agreements aids in an orderly process of international trade by making contract models available that are easy to identify and understand in all languages.

Under CFR, the seller is also required to give the buyer the documentation necessary to pick up the goods from the carrier. With CFR agreements, the shipping party has a greater amount of responsibility in arranging and paying for transportation than with minimal free on board (FOB) shipping, where the shipper is only responsible for delivering goods to the port of origin for shipping. The agreement does not, however, require the seller to purchase marine insurance against the loss, destruction, or damage to the goods during transit. The risk to the goods passes once they reach the vessel, so the seller is not liable. The receiver—or buyer—assumes responsibility once the goods are loaded on the vessel. All remaining costs including those for unloading and any further transportation costs are assumed by the receiver or buyer. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Decoding Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) Obligations Like CFR, CIF is restricted for use between parties who deal in goods that are transported by sea.
