in high APRs. - Credit card cash advance: If you have a credit card that allows cash advances, you could tap some of your credit limit with an ATM withdrawal. Cash advance APRs tend to be higher than a card's purchase APRâand they also come with an upfront feeâbut they're still less expensive than many other emergency loan options. - Financial assistance programs: Depending on your needs, you may be able to get help with certain basic expenses through programs offered by the government and community organizations. If you need help with groceries, rent, utilities, housing costs, medical bills or other basic needs, call 211 to learn more about local resources. - Borrowing from friends or family: If you have a loved one who is willing to help out, consider asking for a loan. To minimize the potential impact on the relationship, be sure to draw up an official loan agreement and pay it back as agreed. - Payday loan: While a payday loan is technically an emergency option, it's always best to pursue other options. This is because payday loans charge staggering feesâyou can expect an APR in the neighborhood of 400% or higherâand they typically require full payment within just a couple of weeks. - How to Improve Bad Credit Once your financial needs are met, taking steps to improve your credit can put you in a better position to get affordable financing the next time something goes wrong.

If you're behind on payments, getting caught up can help avoid further damage to your score. - Pay down credit card balances. Your credit utilization rateâthe percentage of available revolving credit you're using at a given timeâis another important factor in your credit score. Paying off credit card debt can provide a relatively quick improvement to your score. - Avoid too many credit applications. As you work to rebuild your credit history, it's important to avoid applying for credit unless you really need it. While a single hard inquiry won't have much of an impact on your credit score, multiple inquiries in a short period can have a compounding effect. - Get credit for non-debt payments. With Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸, you can add certain payments to your Experian credit file that typically don't get reported to the credit bureaus. This can include rent, utilities, phone, insurance and even some streaming subscription payments.

If you don't already have one, take steps to create a budget by detailing your income and expenses over the past few months.
