How Long Do Collections Stay on Your Credit Report? Quick Answer A debt in collections appears on your credit reports for seven years from the month of the first missed payment that triggered the collection effort. A collection account can damage your credit scores, but its impact will lessen over time. A debt in collections remains on your credit reports for seven years from the month of the first missed payment that led to the collection process. A collection account can damage your credit scores as long as it appears on your reports, but its negative effect on your scores lessens over time. What Are Collections on Your Credit Report? A collection account on your credit report is a record of a defaulted debt. It usually represents a debt that has gone unpaid for at least 120 days that the creditor has turned over to a debt collector. The collector can be from an in-house collection department, a third-party collection agency or a debt buyer who assumes the debt. Once they make contact with you about the debt, the collector typically notifies the credit bureausâExperian, TransUnion and Equifaxâthat they have taken over the debt and indicates the amount they are seeking. That information then appears on your credit report, where it can negatively affect your credit scores. Tip: Collections are often associated with types of consumer debt routinely tracked on credit reports, such as installment loans and credit cards. But they can also include bills that don't normally appear on credit reports, such as unpaid utility or medical bills. What Happens When an Account Goes Into Collections? A creditor typically sends an account to collections only after you've missed several consecutive payments, and only after multiple attempts to reach you to arrange payment. If those efforts fail and they turn the debt over to a collection agency, here's what happens: The collector issues a debt validation letter. When the debt collector takes over the debt, they will reach out to you by phone, text, email or postal mail to attempt to collect the debt. Within five days of that initial contact, they must send a debt validation letter by postal mail or email. The letter spells out the source of the debt, the amount you owe and contact information for the collection agent. If you think any information in the letter is inaccurate, you have 30 days from receipt of the letter to request verification in writing. - The collection account may appear in your credit reports. The debt collector may report the collection account to the credit bureaus. If the collection is related to one of your existing debt accounts, that account will be marked closed or transferred. The new collection account will appear as a separate account on your credit report. - Efforts to get payment will continueâor escalate. By law, a collection agent may attempt to gain payment by phone, email, text message or social media but they cannot harass you. You have the right to ask collectors to stop contacting you. - The collector might sue. A collector may file a lawsuit against you and, if successful, may be able to garnish your wages or bank account. - Learn more: How Does Debt Collection Work? What Debt Can Be Sent to Collections?
