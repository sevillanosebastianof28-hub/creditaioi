total cost is more important to you. If your priority is keeping your budget flexible, a lower monthly payment might make sense. But if you can afford a higher payment, choosing the loan with the lowest total cost can save you hundredsâor even thousandsâof dollars over time. Here's an example of two hypothetical scenarios for someone looking to borrow $10,000: Terms | Loan A | Loan B | ---|---|---| Loan amount | $10,000 | $10,000 | ---|---|---| Interest rate | 10% | 13% | ---|---|---| Repayment term | 3 years | 5 years | ---|---|---| Monthly payment | $322.67 | $227.53 | ---|---|---| Total interest paid | $1,616.19 | $3,651.84 | ---|---|---| How to Apply for a Personal Loan Applying for a personal loan is often fast and straightforward, especially with lenders that let you complete the process online. Here are some steps you can take to apply: Start with prequalification. Many lenders offer a prequalification process that uses a soft credit check, which won't affect your credit score. You'll typically need to share basic personal details, along with the loan amount and how you plan to use it. - Review your loan offers. If you're prequalified, you'll receive estimated offers with potential interest rates, terms and monthly payments. You can compare these offers and choose the one that fits your needs. - Submit a full application. Once you select an offer, you'll complete a formal loan application with your chosen lender. This process typically results in a hard inquiry on your credit reports, which can affect your credit score. - Provide supporting documentation. In some cases, lenders may request additional documents to verify your identity and income. Be sure to provide accurate and up-to-date information to avoid delays or denial. - Wait for final approval. Even if you were prequalified, final approval isn't guaranteed. Depending on the situation, you may receive a decision instantly, or you may need to first provide supporting documentation. - Review the loan offer. If you're approved, take some time to review the terms and conditions of the agreement before accepting it, as they may or may not be the same as the initial quote. If you agree to the terms, sign the contract and provide banking details so the lender can disburse the funds. - Compare personal loan rates Find APRs from 4.99% to 35.99% and flexible terms of 12 to 120 months. Loan amounts range from $1,000 up to $250,000, with funding available the same day or up to 7 days.
