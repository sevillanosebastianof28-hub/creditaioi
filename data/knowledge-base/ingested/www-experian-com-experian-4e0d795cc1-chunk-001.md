6 Reasons Your Credit Score Isnât Increasing It can be frustrating to see that your credit score isn't going up. Fortunately, though, there may be at least one logicalâand fixableâreason that your credit score is stuck. Your credit score might not be increasing for a variety of reasons, such as high balances and a limited credit history. Learn more about why your credit score may be frozen in place and what you can do to turn the situation around. 1. You've Missed Some Payments Your record of making timely or late payments to credit card issuers and other lenders is the No. 1 factor in calculating your credit score. Your payment history makes up about 35% of your FICOÂ® ScoreÎ, which is the credit score used by 90% of top lenders. While your creditor may consider your payment late if it's just one day past due, a late payment won't get reported to the credit bureau unless it's at least 30 days past due. Just one late payment on your credit report can lead to a big drop in your credit score. A late payment normally stays on your credit report for seven years, but the effect on your credit score becomes less severe over time. By consistently making on-time payments after missing some, you should see your credit score rise. Instantly raise your credit scoresÃ¸ 2. Your Debt Balances Are High The amounts owed on your debt accounts (loans and credit cards) is one of the most important factors in your credit score. Loans you're closer to paying off contribute more positively to your score than balances you're just starting to pay off. And credit card balances specifically impact what's known as your credit utilization ratio, which is the amount of revolving credit you're using divided by your credit limit. As your credit card balances go up, along with your credit utilization ratio, so does the risk you present to a lender. For that reason, it's recommended for the benefit of your FICOÂ® Score or VantageScoreÂ® credit score that you keep your credit utilization ratio as low as possible, or at least under 30%. This means that if your total credit limit for all revolving credit accounts is $10,000, your total credit balances debt shouldn't be above $3,000. 3. You Have a Limited Credit History A limited credit history could be yet another reason why your credit score isn't increasing. Data that goes into figuring out the length of your credit history includes: The average age of your accounts - The age of your oldest account - The amount of time since you last opened an account - A longer credit history is generally a positive for your credit score, while a shorter credit history is generally a negative. A limited credit history can, therefore, keep your credit score from rising. What can you do to improve your credit history? In many cases, it may be a simple matter of waiting, as it takes time to bulk up your credit history. You might be able to speed things along by becoming an authorized user on a family member's credit card. When you're an authorized user, you enjoy the benefit of the primary cardholder's credit history and can use the card to make purchases (if the primary cardholder agrees). If the primary cardholder makes on-time payments and maintains a low balance, your credit score could improve. Keep in mind that for this approach to work, the issuer of the credit card must report you as an authorized user to the credit reporting companies. 4. You've Submitted Too Many Credit Applications When you apply for new credit and a lender checks your credit reports, it triggers what's known as a hard inquiry. A couple of hard inquiries as you're routinely applying for a loan or credit card might have little, if
