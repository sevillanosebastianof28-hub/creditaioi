Data and research Find research we’ve published and information we’ve collected about the consumer financial marketplace. Use these resources to improve your understanding of the marketplace. Our research and reports Explore our reports on a variety of subjects including financial well-being, consumer complaints, debt collection and lending practices, mortgage origination and servicing, payday lending, consumer experiences and financial education, and more. Consumer credit trends We present data collected as part of our efforts to monitor consumer credit market conditions. These dashboards are updated monthly to reflect the latest market developments. Mortgage performance trends We publish data on mortgage delinquency rates. See how trends change over time and across geographies. Consumer finance research hub Our PhD social scientists design and conduct foundational, policy-relevant research on consumer finance and household behavior. Consumer Complaint Database We send thousands of consumers’ complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. Data from those complaints help us understand the financial marketplace and protect consumers. HMDA data The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose information about mortgages. We’ve made data available in an interactive tool and a public API. Small business lending database The CFPB’s small business lending database will be the most comprehensive source of publicly available information on U.S. small business lending. Credit card agreements and surveys We maintain and provide access to resources where you can learn more about credit cards, including general credit card agreement terms and conditions and survey data about pricing and fees. Prepaid account agreements We provide a searchable database of prepaid account agreements, along with resources to help prepaid account issuers submit agreements in compliance with the Prepaid Rule. Survey of mortgage originations We survey consumers who took out a mortgage in the past 18 months or so — including refinancing a mortgage — in order to know about your experience. Financial well-being survey data We measured the financial well-being of adults in America: their sense of financial security and freedom of choice—both in the present and when considering the future—and other factors that may support financial well-being. Nonbank registry The CFPB’s nonbank registry will provide a list of nonbanks that have registered certain information with the CFPB and is designed to detect and deter corporate offenders that have broken consumer laws and are subject to federal, state, or local government or court orders. CFPB Researchers The CFPB's Office of Research undertakes rigorous and innovative research to improve our understanding of consumer behavior, financial service providers, markets and effects of regulation and other public policies in consumer finance. CFPB Research Conference Our seventh conference held on May 2–3, 2024, featured research from a range of disciplines and approaches that inform the topic of consumer finance. Making Ends Meet The Making Ends Meet Survey program is a series of general financial surveys that examine consumers’ evolving financial status. How we handle personally identifiable information At the CFPB, we have nine privacy principles that guide when and how we collect, use, share, and protect personally identifiable information (PII).
