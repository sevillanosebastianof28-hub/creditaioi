20 Tax Deductions to Claim if Youâre Self-Employed Quick Answer If youâre self-employed, you can deduct a wide range of business-related expenses, including retirement contributions, computer equipment expenses and more. More than 16.6 million Americans are self-employed, according to December 2025 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Self-employment can translate to more independence and greater choice when it comes to your work hours and location. But it can also come with a more complicatedâand more expensiveâtax bill. If you work for yourself, you can claim a variety of deductions to lower your taxes. Here are 20 tax deductions that freelancers, contractors and other self-employed taxpayers can use to save money on their tax bills. 1. Self-Employment Tax Half of any self-employment tax you pay is deductible from your adjusted gross income. What's self-employment tax? Because self-employed people don't have an employer who covers Social Security and Medicare taxes for them, they pay these taxes on their own through a 15.3% self-employment tax. The tax breaks down this way: 12.4% of your net business income goes to Social Security - 2.9% goes to Medicare - In 2025, only your first $176,100 of income is taxed for Social Security; all of your self-employment income is taxed for Medicare. You may owe an additional 0.9% Medicare tax if your income exceeds $200,000 (or $250,000 filing jointly and $125,000 if you're married filing separately). Anyone who makes $400 or more from self-employment in a year must pay self-employment tax.

Plus, many services provide audit assistance to give you confidence when you file. 2. Qualified Business Income Self-employed taxpayers may be eligible to deduct up to 20% of their net business income using the qualified business income deduction (QBID). Qualified business income (QBI) refers to income from partnerships, limited liability corporations (LLCs), S corporations and sole proprietorships operating in the United States. QBI includes the deductible part of self-employment tax, health insurance premiums, business interest expense and deductions for contributions to qualified retirement plans. It does not include investment gains and dividends, interest income, foreign income or wages. Keep the following in mind when determining whether you qualify for the QBID: Your total taxable income must be less than $197,300 for a single filer or $394,600 for joint filers to qualify for the full deduction (based on 2025 numbers). After that, the deduction begins phasing out. - Limitations apply to certain service businesses, including attorneys, accountants, performing artists, actuaries and health care practices. However, these limitations only come into play when your income exceeds the thresholds shown above. - Taxpayers whose income exceeds the thresholds must also comply with limitations on deducting any W-2 wages they've paid. - QBID is available whether you take the standard deduction or itemize.

Start-Up Costs You may deduct up to $5,000 in business start-up costs and $5,000 in organizational costs, including advertising, travel and training expenses you incur before you open your business. Your $5,000 deductions for start-up and organizational costs are reduced when your costs exceed $50,000. Above the $50,000 threshold, your deductible costs may be amortized or spread out over multiple years. 4. Home Office Expenses Employees working remotely can't deduct their home office expenses, but self-employed people can. This deduction applies only to space used regularly and exclusively for business that is also your principal place of business. You can't claim the sofa as your headquarters if you also use it as a place to watch TV with your family. Similarly, if you maintain a regular office and use your guest room as a home office occasionally, the deduction doesn't apply. Deductible expenses include mortgage interest or rent, utilities, insurance, depreciation, real estate taxes, maintenance and repairs. -
