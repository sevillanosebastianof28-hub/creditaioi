Is It Better to Lease or Buy a Car? Quick Answer Leasing offers lower monthly payments and lets you drive newer cars, but buying builds equity and has no mileage limits. Your choice depends on your budget, driving habits and whether you prefer ownership or flexibility. The choice between leasing and buying a car depends on your budget, lifestyle and financial goals. Leasing works well if you want lower monthly payments, prefer driving newer cars and don't need to build equity. In contrast, buying makes more sense if you want to avoid mileage and usage restrictions, plan to keep the car long term or need trade-in value for your next purchase. Here's what to consider when deciding which option fits your needs. Leasing | Buying | ---|---| Ownership | You don't own the vehicle; return it at lease end | You own the vehicle outright after loan payoff | ---|---|---| Down payment | Typically lower or none required | Typically higher upfront payment required | ---|---|---| Monthly payments | Lower monthly payments | Higher monthly payments | ---|---|---| Usage restrictions | Mileage limits and wear-and-tear penalties apply | No restrictions on mileage, wear and tear or modifications | ---|---|---| Equity | Doesn't build equity in the vehicle | Builds equity you can use toward next vehicle | ---|---|---| How Does Leasing a Car Work? When you lease a car, you're essentially renting it for a set periodâtypically two to four years. Instead of paying for the entire vehicle, you only pay for the depreciation that occurs during your lease term. Your monthly payment is based on the difference between the car's value when you lease it and its projected residual value when you return it. At the end of your lease, you have three options: Return the vehicle to the dealership and buy a different vehicle, purchase the leased car for the predetermined residual value or lease a new car. Most leases include mileage limits (usually 10,000 to 15,000 miles per year) and require you to maintain the vehicle in good condition. Learn more: How Much Do Cars Depreciate per Year? Benefits of Leasing a Car Leasing can be attractive if you want lower upfront costs, minimal repair expenses or the flexibility to switch vehicles regularly. Here are the key advantages of leasing. Certain Costs Are Lower When you lease a car, you're only paying for the vehicle's depreciation during your lease term. Your monthly payment is based on the difference between the car's initial value and its residual valueâwhat the dealer projects it will be worth when you return it. This typically results in lower monthly payments compared to auto loans. Leases also often require little to no down payment, and because you're driving a new vehicle, maintenance and repair costs are usually minimal. Learn more: How Much Does It Cost to Lease a Car? New Car Experience With lease terms typically ranging from two to four years, you'll consistently drive a new or nearly new vehicle. This appeals to drivers who want the latest features and technology or those whose jobs require maintaining a professional appearance. Leasing also allows you to drive a higher-end or larger vehicle than you might be able to afford to purchase outright. Less Hassle Returning a leased vehicle is generally more straightforward than selling a car you own. You won't need to prep the vehicle for sale, screen potential buyers, negotiate prices or handle title transfers. When your lease ends, simply return the car to the dealership. You'll also have the option to purchase it if you've grown attached to it. Drawbacks of Leasing a Car While leasing offers advantages, it can cost more over time and comes with restrictions that limit your flexibility. Here are the key disadvantages.
