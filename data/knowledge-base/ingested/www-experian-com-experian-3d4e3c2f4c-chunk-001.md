7 Tips for Spending Money Wisely Quick Answer Spending money wisely starts with making a budget that prioritizes your needs before wants. Other strategies for smart spending include being disciplined with credit, watching your costs and narrowing the number of payment options you use. The way you spend money has a big impact on your financial well-being. Overspending can strain your budget, leading to debt and other financial problems. On the other hand, spending wisely allows you to build savings, limit debt and begin building wealth. The following seven tips can help you spend wisely, including making a budget, spending on needs before wants and being smart with credit. 1. Create and Stick to a Budget Having a budget is the key to keeping your spending in check. A budget is the master plan for how you're going to spend your money and ensures you don't spend more than you make. The basic steps of creating a budget are pretty straightforward. Calculate your monthly income. - List your expenses. - Allocate some money to savings and debt. - Adjust your planned spending if it exceeds your income. - Stick to your budget throughout the month. - The 50/30/20 budgeting method is relatively simple and a good place to start to keep your spending on track. There are other budgeting methods you can explore to find what works best for you. For instance, you may need a different budget if you're paid monthly. Your budget is meant to keep you on track, but it doesn't have to be restrictive. If you have enough room in your budget, build in a buffer for unplanned spending. 2. Prioritize Needs Over Wants It may be tempting to splurge, but it's important to know the difference between what you need to survive and what you want in the moment. Spending so much on dining out, entertainment, clothes and the like that you're having a hard time paying your monthly bills and groceries could land you in debt. Focusing on your needs first is part of the foundation for financial security. During your budgeting process, note expenses you should prioritize and those that should wait until you know you can afford them without going into debt. Essential living expenses like a mortgage, food costs and transportation costs are priorities, while things like vacations and hobbies can wait. 3. Use Your Credit Cardâbut Pay It Off Each Month Using your credit card is a great way to build credit and earn lucrative rewards, as long as you can pay it off each month. Credit cards allow you to live beyond your meansâa big mistake when trying to spend wisely, avoid debt, build wealth and ensure financial security. Use the two tips above to figure out how much you can safely spend on your cards each month. Then commit to paying off your credit card each month so you avoid paying interest and getting into debt. 4. Know Your Valuesâand Your Triggers Take time to identify what's truly important to you and allow your values to guide your spending. For instance, spending extra money on fitness classes makes sense if health and well-being are important to you. Likewise, it's important to know what tempts you to overspend. By recognizing your spending triggers, you can eliminate temptation or find another outlet when you feel tempted to pull out your credit card. 5. Reduce Spending Where It Makes Sense Cutting costs is a good practice no matter how much you make. Every few months, review your spending and look for areas where you can cut back or eliminate expenses. Consider cheaper options, potential discounts and subscriptions that have raised prices or that you're no longer using. For example, a quick phone call to your insurance company that saves you several hundred dollars a year is worth it. Eliminating unnecessary spending
