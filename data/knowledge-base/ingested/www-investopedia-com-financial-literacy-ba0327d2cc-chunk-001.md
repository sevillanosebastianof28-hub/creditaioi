Banking in the 21st century means being able to conduct all transactions digitally without needing to physically visit a branch location. Deposits, withdrawals, payments, and transfers can be conducted online or by phone app as well as applications for credit cards and loans. Banks are a very important part of the economy because they provide vital services for both consumers and businesses. Banks provide a secure way to store, protect and provide access to customer deposits. Consumers can conduct routine banking transactions through checking accounts, ATMs and electronic transfers while earning interest on their deposits held in deposit accounts like savings, certificates of deposits and in certain demand deposit accounts. The federal government began offering insurance on bank deposits in March 1933 through the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) after more than 9,000 banks failed as a result of the great depression. The FDIC is an independent agency that was created to boost confidence in the health and well-being of the national financial system and currently offers $250,000 of coverage per customer, per account. Larger banks can provide relatively more financial stability compared to smaller financial institutions like state and community banks and other financial institutions. While the U.S. banking system is very strong, including at the state and community level, larger banks are usually nationally chartered commercial banks that are guaranteed to provide FDIC insurance on deposits and are less likely to default on their obligations due to federally mandated capital reserve requirements. A national bank is a commercial bank that is chartered by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency and functions as a member bank of the Federal Reserve, as well as being an investing member of its district Federal Reserve Bank. National banks are required to be members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and provide deposit insurance coverage to their customers. Bank fees are charges levied by banks and other financial institutions on their personal and business customers for things like account set-up, maintenance, and transactional services. Other examples of bank fees are wire transfer fees, automated teller machine (ATM) fees, non-sufficient fund (NSF) fees, and late payment charges. A deposit with a bank refers to money held by the financial institution in a customer account. Deposits are held by banks for safekeeping and typically earn interest depending on the type of account. A checking account is a type of bank account held at a financial institution that permits withdrawals and deposits on a daily transactional basis. Checking accounts are also known as demand deposit accounts because they are highly liquid and can be accessed by writing checks, withdrawing or depositing funds with automated teller machines, and by debit card transactions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent federal agency insuring deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts to protect customers from bank failures. The FDIC was created during the great depression to maintain public confidence and provide stability to the financial system through the promotion of sound banking practices. The FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor for customers of member banks. A bank statement is a document sent from a financial institution to an account holder, either by mail or delivered electronically, that details monthly account activity, showing the account number and all the transactions in sequential order processed during the previous account cycle. Underbanked refers to people or segments of society who may have an account with a financial institution but choose to rely on very expensive non-bank sources of financial services such as wire-transfer or check-cashing services, title loans and payday loans instead of more traditional sources of retail banking services like debit and credit cards, demand deposit accounts and personal loans to meet their daily financial needs. This may be due to lack of access due to lower credit scores, not having banks near their
