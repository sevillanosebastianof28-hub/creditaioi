for a payday consolidation loan. That might not be the case, though. You may be able to get a consolidation loan even if your credit score is low, although you might end up with a higher interest rate than you would with a high score.

If you're unable to qualify for a traditional consolidation loan, you might consider a payday alternative loan (PAL) from a credit union. You can use a PAL, with a maximum APR of 28%, to consolidate and pay off high-interest payday loans. Credit unions typically give you up to six months to pay off a PAL. Payday Loan Consolidation vs. Debt Settlement If you're deciding between payday loan consolidation and debt settlement, consolidation may be the better option. Debt settlement can pose "far more" risk than debt consolidation, according to the National Federation for Credit Counseling Why? Because debt settlement companies tend to charge hefty fees, and the process may result in significant damage to your credit. Debt settlement companies negotiate on your behalf in hopes that you'll pay less to your creditors than what you owe. There's no guarantee that debt settlement will work, however, which can leave you worse off than you were before. Debt settlement companies often market their services as "debt consolidation," but keep in mind that debt settlement and debt consolidation aren't the same thing. Debt settlement means paying less than what you owe on a debt; debt consolidation means your other loans will be paid as agreed and you'll now have one "consolidated" loan payment each month until the new, lower-interest loan is paid. Does Payday Loan Consolidation Hurt My Credit? While a payday loan normally doesn't appear on your credit report, a payday consolidation loan typically does. Depending on how you manage the consolidation loan, it has the potential to help or hurt your credit. When you initially apply for a payday consolidation loan, you can expect to see a small but temporary dip in your credit score. That happens because the lender's request to view your credit report or score shows up on your credit report as a "hard inquiry." The addition of the payday consolidation loan could also result in a ding to your credit score because it'll bring down the average age of your accounts. In the long run, however, your scores can see an improvement. Making timely payments on the consolidation loan, keeping balances low on your other credit accounts and avoiding unnecessary applications for credit can help drive this increase. By consolidating, you're also freeing yourself from the high-interest debt of your payday loans, which can save you money and make your debt payments more affordable.
