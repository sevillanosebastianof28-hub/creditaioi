How to Get a Loan Without a Job Quick Answer If you donât have a job, you may be able to get a loan by using other sources of income, such as earned income, government benefits, investment income and court-ordered income. You can also try applying with a cosigner or getting a secured loan. Making ends meet can be tough when you don't have a job. A loan can be a useful tool for covering unexpected or everyday expenses. It's possible to qualify for a loan if you're unemployed, but you'll likely need solid credit and another source of income. Understanding where to look and how to prove you can afford loan payments can help you get a loan even if you don't have a job. Can I Get a Loan Without a Job? Lenders use your income along with your credit score and debt payments to approve your loan application and determine whether you can afford monthly payments. You typically need a steady and verifiable source of income to get a loan. Fortunately, your income doesn't have to come from a traditional job. Potential Income Types Many lenders are willing to consider other forms of income than a job when they're evaluating your loan application. Lenders typically want to see steady, predictable income, even when the income doesn't come from a traditional job. Funds you receive just onceâlike a tax refund, inheritance or profit from selling assetsâmay not be enough to help you qualify for a loan, but you may be able to use several other types of income or assets to qualify for a loan. These include: Personal income: You may be able to qualify by reporting income from freelance or gig work or self-employment income. Irregular income may be averaged. - Government benefits: Unemployment compensation, Social Security or disability benefits, government annuity and public assistance payments may qualify. - Retirement or investment income: Lenders may consider regular income from pension funds or other retirement benefit payments, regular proceeds from a trust, recurring interest or dividend payments or rental property income. - Court-ordered payments: Alimony or child support may be used if they're documented and you expect them to continue. - Cosigner income: You can typically use income from your spouse, partner, relative or another person who's signing the loan with you to count toward your total household income. - Cash: You may be able to borrow against financial assets like cash in a bank account, investments or retirement account balances. - Future income: In limited cases, an employment offer may count as a source of future income, but your lender may require you to also have other income sources in addition. - Be aware: Cash income may not be counted since it's harder for lenders to confirm. If you receive cash income, make sure to deposit it into your bank account regularly and maintain records of your deposits. Prepare Your Documentation You'll need documentation to verify that your income is reliable and sufficient, even when it's from a nontraditional source. Expect to provide detailed, up-to-date proof to provide the lender a clear picture of your income, assets and ability to repay a loan. Lenders will typically require you to provide official documents like PDF statements (not screenshots) you've downloaded directly from your bank. Examples of proof may include: Recent bank or investment account statements - Tax returns - Benefit award letters - Court orders for alimony or child support - Lenders may request additional documentation. Responding quickly avoids delays in processing your application. Assess Existing Debts When you don't have a job, your existing debtsâcredit card, auto loan, student loan and mortgage paymentsâcan make it harder to qualify for a loan. Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is a key factor in loan approval. It shows the percentage of your monthly income that's allocated for debt. Lenders are more
