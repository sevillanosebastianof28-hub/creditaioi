of escapes won't be worth it if you return to insurmountable bills. - Alternatives to Personal Loans for Building Credit If you're looking for ways to build credit, a personal loan can help under the right circumstances, as described above. Here are some other options you can pursue to help improve your credit scores: Credit-builder loan: A credit-builder loan can bolster credit scores and help you save some money. You borrow an amount ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars, and the sum is placed in a special interest-bearing account that you cannot touch for the time being. If you complete your payments (with interest), you build up a payment history that can help your credit scores, and the money in the account is yours to use as you see fit. - Credit-building debit card: The Experian Smart Moneyâ¢ Digital Checking Account & Debit Card can help you build credit without debt by linking to Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸, which gives you credit for eligible bill payments after three months of payments. See terms at experian.com/legal. - Secured credit card: If you're working to establish credit as a new user or rebuilding damaged credit, a secured credit card can help. You put down a cash deposit that usually serves as your credit limit. If you don't pay your bills on time, your deposit is used to make your payments. By making charges and repaying them on time, you can amass a positive payment history that will tend to improve your credit scores. - The Bottom Line Whether it's for debt consolidation, emergency expenses or other uses, a personal loan has the potential to help (or hurt) your credit scores. If you manage it responsibly and keep up with all your other debt payments, a personal loan can be a useful tool in your credit arsenal. Need a personal loan?
