I provide to Equifax.com? Does placing a fraud alert hurt my credit scores? I received a credit report alert from one or two of the nationwide credit bureaus, but not all three. Why did this occur? How does credit reporting work? Can Equifax assist consumers who are deaf or hard of hearing? Am I better off placing a fraud alert, requesting a security freeze, or obtaining a credit report lock? Who can view my Equifax credit report if I have a security freeze or credit report lock? Can I add a statement to my Equifax credit report? What can I do if I believe my credit file has been mixed with someone else's? How can I prevent errors on my credit reports? How can I get a free Equifax credit report? Where can I find my credit scores? What if I don't recognize an inquiry on my credit reports? Do any Equifax products provide access to a free credit report? After a relative's death, do I need to contact each nationwide credit bureau? How do I get a copy of my child's credit reports? How long does information stay on my Equifax credit report? How do I correct or dispute information on my Equifax credit report? I just received my free Equifax annual credit report from annualcreditreport.com. Will I be entitled to an additional copy of my Equifax credit report?
