How Do Cash Back Credit Cards Work? Quick Answer Cash back credit cards provide a rebate or refund on purchases up to a certain amount. Some cards offer flat-rate cash back, while others reward cash back only in certain categoriesâwhich may change quarterly. A cash back credit card is a type of rewards card that refunds a percentage of the amount you spend. As you use the card, you'll earn cash back as a reward, typically at a flat percentage or only in specific categories that may change at regular intervals. You can redeem cash rewards in various ways, including via check, direct deposit or a statement credit that lowers your balance due. Here's what to know about how cash back credit cards work. What Is a Cash Back Card? A cash back credit card returns a portion of your spending to you as an incentive for making purchases. These cards can offer either flat-rate cash backâ1.5% back on all purchases, for exampleâor higher rates of cash back in particular categories. Example: If you spend a lot on groceries, you may choose a card that offers 3% cash back at your favorite grocery stores and 1% cash back on everything else. Still other cards provide 5% or more cash back in categories that rotate quarterly. All cash back credit cards let you redeem your rewards for cash, often via a check, statement credit, bank transfer or at checkout at certain stores. Some travel credit cards provide cash back as a rewards redemption option tooâbut you'll typically get more value from your points or miles if you use the rewards on travel instead of cash back.

If your card offers a flat 2% cash back on purchases, you'll get $2 in rewards for every $100 you spend. Charging $1,500 in one statement cycle would lead to $30 in cash back that month. You can then choose to receive that $30 as a refund, known as a statement credit, or as a deposit to your bank account, among other redemption options. Here are three ways these types of credit cards offer cash back: Flat-Rate Cards With a flat-rate cash back card, you earn the same amount of cash back on every purchaseâoften, 1% or 2%. Some cards also offer flat-rate rewards on payments, though the rewards rate is typically lower than the rate for purchases. Flat-rate cards can be a good fit for people who don't want to spend a lot of time managing a credit card rewards program. It's easy to compare flat-rate cards to each other, and you'll know exactly how much you're earning on every purchase. Be sure to check whether the card has an annual fee or other fees that will offset the rewards you earn. Bonus Categories or Tiered Rewards Cards Some cash back cards offer different levels of rewards depending on where you use the card. For example, there are dining cards that give bonus cash back on take out and at restaurants, and gas cards with bonus cash back at gas stations. Many cash back cards have several tiers, such as 2% cash back on dining and 3% on gas. There may also be a limit to the amount of bonus cash back you can earn each quarter or year. Generally, you can earn an unlimited 1% cash back on all non-bonus category purchases. A tiered rewards card can be best when you tend to spend most of your money at particular types of retailers. They're also helpful if you have several rewards cards and can remember to pick the card that offers the most rewards on each purchase. Rotating Rewards Cards A rotating cash back rewards
