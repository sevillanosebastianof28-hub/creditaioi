mortgages is that they have higher monthly payments. On the upside, you'll own your home sooner and you will have paid less in interest over the life of the loan. Who Should Consider a 20-Year Mortgage? If you can afford the larger monthly payments, a 20-year mortgage would be worth looking into. While your payments will be higher, your lender may offer you a lower interest rate than it would on a 30-year mortgage. As mentioned, you'll also pay less interest over the 20-year life of the loan although you'll pay more interest with each monthly payment. At the same time, you'll be building equity more quickly, which might be useful if you later decide to apply for a home equity loan or home equity line of credit. In addition, many people find it comforting to have their mortgages totally paid off, especially if they are heading into retirement. A 20-year mortgage can be one way of reaching that goal more quickly. 15-Year Mortgage Rates Loan Type Purchase Refinance 15-Year Fixed 5.43% 5.43% Jumbo 15-Year Fixed 6.29% 6.23% What Is a 15-Year Mortgage? Like 30- and 20-year mortgages, the 15-year mortgages covered here have fixed monthly payments. Those payments will be higher, but the loan will be paid off faster, and you'll save on interest in total. Who Should Consider a 15-Year Mortgage? If you can afford the payments on a 15-year mortgage, it could be a good choice. It would also make sense if you want to pay off your home loan on a shorter time frame than 20 or 30 years and get a rate lock for that abbreviated period. 10-Year Mortgage Rates Loan Type Purchase Refinance 10-Year Fixed 5.63% 5.89% What Is a 10-Year Mortgage Finally, some lenders also offer 10-year mortgages, typically the shortest fixed-rate loan available to homebuyers. The same principle applies as with the other shorter-duration mortgages described above: the terms of the loan mean larger monthly payments but less interest overall by the time the loan is paid off. Who Should Consider a 10-Year Mortgage? Again, this is largely a question of how large a monthly payment you can comfortably afford. If you have the cash to spare, a 10-year loan will be a money saver in the long term. It could also make sense if you're in a hurry to own your home free and clear. If you're in the fortunate position of being able to afford a 10-year mortgage, you might also consider simply paying cash for the home and avoiding interest and other mortgage-related costs altogether.

Trends in Mortgage Rates: Will They Continue Falling? Trends in mortgage rates are influenced by complex factors, such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, employment rate, the Consumer Price Index, and the yields of 10-year treasury bonds. Mortgage rates are not directly tied to any of these factors but are indirectly influenced by their current levels and consensus predictions on how they will trend in the near future. Mortgage rates are determined by a complex interaction of macroeconomic and industry factors, such as: The level and direction of the bond market, especially 10-year Treasury yields The Federal Reserve's current monetary policy, especially as it relates to bond buying and funding government-backed mortgages Competition between mortgage lenders and across loan types Because any number of these can cause fluctuations simultaneously, it's generally difficult to attribute the change to any one factor. Macroeconomic factors kept the mortgage market relatively low for much of 2021. In particular, the Federal Reserve had been buying billions of dollars
