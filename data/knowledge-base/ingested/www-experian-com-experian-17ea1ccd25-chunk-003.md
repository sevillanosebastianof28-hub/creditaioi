Uncooperative If the person listed on the title will not help, your next step is to contact your state DMV, explain your situation and ask for your best options. You may still be able to apply for a bonded title if the owner is unavailable or uncooperative. You may be able to get a bonded title by purchasing a surety bond for the vehicle's estimated value. The bonds act as protection in case someone later claims they own the vehicle. After a waiting period, typically three years, you can request a clean title in your name. What to Do if the Title Owner Is Deceased If the owner listed on the title has died, you'll typically need to go through probate before the DMV can issue a title in your name. If you are inheriting the car, you can often apply using the old title, the death certificate and proof that you've inherited the vehicle. If the title is missing, you may need proof you are the beneficiary by supplying a death certificate, a probate-issued inheritance letter, your ID and other supporting documentation.

Never keep the title in the glove box. Don't store the title to your car in its glove compartment because a car thief could use it to get a car title loan in your name or sell the vehicle to someone else. - Store it in a secure place. Consider storing your title in a fireproof safe in your home to protect it from damage. You could also use a safe deposit box at your bank or a fire-resistant document bag. - Keep a digital backup. For convenience, you could always scan both sides of your title to your laptop or computer. - Tip: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) advises you to take the additional steps to encrypt any drive storing sensitive information and back it up to a secure external hard drive or a vetted cloud platform. The Bottom Line If you lose your title or it's too damaged for use, all is not lost. Most of the time, it's relatively easy to get a replacement title through your DMV. Refer to the steps above to get this important document and work through other common title issues. One way to prevent title issues with your next vehicle is to run an AutoCheck vehicle history report through Experian before you buy. It flags salvage titles, odometer fraud, outstanding liens and other title or damage problems so you can avoid unnecessary hassles down the road. What makes a good credit score?
