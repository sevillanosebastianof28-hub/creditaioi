Comparing Auto Loans: New Car Loans vs Used Car Loans Highlights: It may be easier to secure a loan for a new car than it is for a used car, and new car loans often come with lower interest rates. - Used cars can be a good fit if you're on a budget and they generally cost less to insure; however, interest rates for used car loans are often higher than for new car loans. - A pre-qualification may make it easier to compare different loans and to negotiate rates and other features when you're finally ready to buy. - Buying a car is a big commitment, one that can impact your financial situation for years to come. So, the age-old question for many buyers is this: Is it better to finance a new or used car? Whether you're hitting the dealership for a good deal on a used car or looking to drive off the lot in the latest model, here's what to know about new vs. used car loans. How do car loans work? Car loans are installment loans, meaning the borrower receives a lump sum of money from the lender that they pay back, with interest, over time. Auto loans are generally secured by collateral— in this case, the car itself. Should you fail to honor the terms of your loan, you may risk having your vehicle repossessed to pay off your debt. Many types of lenders offer car loans, from traditional banks to online loan providers. Sometimes, you can even borrow through a car dealership. Once you're approved for a loan, lenders will require you to pay back the borrowed money in monthly installments. Many lenders will also require a down payment. This is a portion of the car's price that you'll pay up front in cash to show the lender that you're serious about the purchase. It's common for borrowers to aim for 20% down, though many lenders will accept significantly less. It's important to note, however, that the size of your down payment could impact the interest rates you're offered by a lender. Buyers who put 20% or more down on their vehicle are generally more likely to receive more favorable interest rates. On the flip side, a smaller down payment may result in higher interest rates over the life of the loan. New vs. used car loans The biggest difference between new and used car loans is price. New cars are almost always more expensive than used cars. A higher sticker price will be reflected in the size of your loan's principal, or the amount you owe before interest and other fees. A bigger principal generally means you'll have higher loan payments over a longer period of time. However, new car loans typically have lower interest rates than those for used cars. On the other hand, used cars are cheaper and tend to have smaller principles and, therefore, shorter loan terms than a new car. However, used cars may have higher interest rates than you would find on a new car loan. This is because it's harder for lenders to accurately value a used car compared to a new one. Remember that the rates you'll be offered for a loan will also be affected by your financial history and credit scores. Lenders use your credit scores as one factor when considering your creditworthiness, or how likely you are to pay your bills on time. Generally speaking, the higher your credit scores, the more creditworthy you will appear to lenders and the more likely you are to receive favorable terms on your loan. It's a good idea to check your credit scores to gauge your financial health and regularly review your credit reports to make sure the information is accurate and complete.
