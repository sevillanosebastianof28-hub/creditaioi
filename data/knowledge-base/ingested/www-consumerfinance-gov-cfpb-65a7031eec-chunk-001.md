Code of Federal Regulations The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) contains the official text of agency regulations and is updated once a year. The CFR is updated by amendments published in the Federal Register. Used together, these two publications establish the latest versions of published regulations. Here you can access electronic copies of the current, complete versions of all CFPB regulations published in the electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR). The eCFR is updated regularly and is an unofficial compilation of both CFR material and Federal Register amendments.
