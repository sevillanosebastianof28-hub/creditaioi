How Long After You Pay Off Debt Does Your Credit Improve? Quick Answer Paying off revolving debt typically increases your credit score in one to two months. Paying off installment debt can cause a temporary dip in your credit score, but scores should bounce back in a few months. Paying off debt is a big accomplishment, but aside from the pride, you may wonder how quickly it will affect your credit score. Your credit score could improve in one to two months after you pay off revolving debt such as credit cards, and may dip, then bounce back in a few months when you pay off installment debt such as a car loan. However, your payment history, credit mix and credit history are also important factors in your credit score. Here's what to expect when you pay off debt. How Long Does It Take for My Credit Score to Improve After Paying Off Debt? How quickly your credit score improves after paying off debt depends on the type of debt, your overall credit mix and your history with the debt, such as whether you had late payments or always paid on time. Revolving Accounts Credit cards are a type of revolving credit, allowing you to borrow money up to your credit limit, repay it and borrow again as you pay the money back. Carrying a balance on a credit card can hurt your credit score if it pushes your credit utilization ratio above 30%. Your credit utilization ratio reflects how much of your available credit you're using at any given time, both on individual credit cards and across all of your accounts. For example, if you have a card with a $2,000 credit limit: A $1,000 balance = 50% utilization - A $200 balance = 10% utilization - Paying down credit card balances to achieve a lower utilization could help increase your credit score. Your credit score will typically improve in one to two months after paying off a revolving credit account. Why doesn't it improve immediately? Lenders usually report your payment information to the national consumer credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) after your billing cycle ends, which could be a few weeks after you pay off your balance. Still, paying down credit cards can be one of the quickest ways to improve your credit score. Learn more: How Often Is My Credit Score Updated? Installment Loans Installment loans are repaid over a set term with fixed monthly payments. Common types of installment loans include student loans, auto loans and mortgages. Unlike revolving credit, once you make the final monthly payment on an installment loan, the account is closed. Paying off an installment loan may not benefit your credit much, and may actually cause your scores to drop in the following situations: The account was your only installment loan. Having a mix of revolving and installment credit helps your credit score. - It was your only account with a low balance. Your score might dip if your remaining active accounts are a long way from being paid off. - Any dips are usually temporary, though: Your credit score should go back to where it was within one or two months, all else being equal. Tip: Consistently making installment loan payments on time can help improve your credit score. A paid-off loan stays on your credit report for up to 10 years after the account closes, which continues to benefit your credit score if the account was in good standing.
