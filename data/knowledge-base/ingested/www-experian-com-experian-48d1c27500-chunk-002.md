aren't responsible for your spouse's debt unless you took it out together as a joint account, or you cosigned on it. There are a few exceptions. While personal debt remains each spouse's individual liability, both spouses usually share responsibility for debts for family essentials that benefit them equally. This could include housing, food and tuition for children's schools. Requirements vary by state, so check your state's laws or consult a local attorney. Individual debt, including credit card accounts and loans, is in the name of one spouse only. That person is generally held solely responsible for repaying it, so the spouse whose name isn't on the debt is protected. Joint debt may be incurred during marriage in a common-law state if both spouses apply for a loan or credit together. In that case, both spouses' credit scores are considered in the lending decision, along with both spouses' incomes and assets. If both spouses' names appear on the loan (mortgage contract, credit cardholder agreement or auto loan note, for example), both are equally responsible for repayment under common-law rules. If your spouse dies, you will generally only be responsible for debts where you were a cosigner, co-borrower or joint account owner. How Community Property States Handle Debt After Marriage Nine states use a different legal framework called community property (see below). In these states, married couples are viewed as jointly and equally owning nearly everything together. Debt assumed during your marriage is understood to be "community" responsibility, with each spouse under equal obligation for repayment. Even if both spouses didn't agree to the debtsâor, even if one spouse didn't know about themâin a community property state, both are equally responsible to cover them. Assets and income are also considered equally shared. Upon your spouse's death, you may remain responsible for debt if it was considered community property. There are some exceptions; for example, inheritances belong exclusively to the person who received it, unless they commingle it in a joint account they share with a spouse. In Which States Are You Responsible for Your Spouse's Debt? Currently, the only states that follow community property laws are: Arizona - California - Idaho - Louisiana - Nevada - New Mexico - Texas - Washington - Wisconsin - Note that in California, Nevada and Washington, community property laws are also applicable to couples who are in registered domestic partnerships. Additionally, Alaska allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement, but it's optional. Does My Spouse's Debt Affect Me? Getting married doesn't affect your credit score directly, since credit reports don't note your marital status. However, there are some situations when your spouse's debt could impact you: Applying for new debt: While you don't share a credit report, both credit reports and scores are considered when a married couple applies for a loan or credit card together. If you have a solid credit score but your spouse has a poor credit history, that could affect your ability to borrow money jointly. It may be harder to qualify for a mortgage or auto loan, or if you do qualify, you may be stuck with higher interest rates and fees. - Budgeting together: If your spouse has a significant amount of debt and you budget together, this could put you on shaky financial ground as a unit. Your partner may not be able to contribute as much to savings or day-to-day expenses if a significant amount of their income goes toward debt payments. - Carrying joint debt: When you take out a loan or a credit card account jointly with your spouse, you're both equally responsible for the payments, even in community property states. If, for instance, one spouse goes on a spending spree with a jointly held credit card, the other is equally on the hook for paying it, even if they weren't aware of the
