Your Money. Your Story. Mortgages. Credit cards. Student loans. Credit scores. Fine print. We want to hear about your experiences with money and financial services, good and bad. The CFPB is listening. Have a complaint about a financial product or service? Submit a complaint and we will forward it to the company and work to get a response from them. Have a money question? Get answers to frequently asked financial questions about student loans, credit cards, mortgages, credit scores and reporting, getting out of debt and more. Here’s how telling your story works: 1. You tell your story We want to hear from you about positive or negative experiences you’ve had with the financial products and services in your life. We take steps to protect your personal information, and your story is never shared with the public without your permission. 2. Your story helps others The more we hear from you, the more insight we gain into what’s happening in the financial world and how it’s affecting you. We see trends and work to head off problems.
