7 Steps to Get Out of Debt in 2026 Quick Answer You can get out of debt in 2026 by first totaling your debt, then choosing a debt repayment strategy and considering debt consolidation options. After, adjust your budget, look for ways to boost your income, look for motivation and try credit counseling. When you're shouldering high balances, debt can be a major source of stress. That's especially true when you're battling high interest rates or feel financially overextended by what you owe. If you have more debt than you'd like, you're not alone. U.S. consumers carry an average debt balance of $104,755, according to Experian data from June 2025. Credit card balances alone (which tend to come with high interest rates) average $6,735 on average per person. Navigating debt can be challenging, but coming up with a plan forward can help. Read on for seven ways to get out of debt this year, including consolidating your debts and rethinking your budget. 1. Take Inventory of Your Debt Before you decide on a strategy for paying off your debts, it's a good idea to get clear on what exactly you owe. Dig through your statements and bills and create a list of all your balances. For each, be sure to note the: Lender name - Total balance - Interest rate - Minimum monthly payment - Payment due date - Account status (current on payments, missing payments, in collections) - If any of your balances are past due, it's a good idea to prioritize getting these accounts back in good standing. That can help you avoid further damage to your credit and minimize late fees. Be sure to list all your debts, including mortgages, student loans, auto loans, credit cards and personal loans. You should even include those debts that aren't among your highest prioritiesâseeing all your debt together gives you the complete picture. Learn more: How Can I Find All My Debt? 2. Use a Debt Repayment Strategy Choosing a debt repayment strategy can help you divide and conquer your debts. Here are the two main methods to choose between. Debt Avalanche Method With the debt avalanche method, you pay off your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest. Continue to make minimum payments on all your other debts, but put extra funds toward your balance with the highest rate. Once that's paid off, focus on the debt with the next highest rate and repeat. Who it may work for: The debt avalanche method works best for those with a goal to save the most on interest while getting out of debt. - Potential downsides: If your highest-interest debt is also your largest balance, it could take a while before you get the satisfaction of seeing the number of paid-off accounts go down. - Debt Snowball Method With the debt snowball method, you put extra funds toward your smallest balance first while making minimum payments on your other debts. The goal is to clear out the number of account balances more quickly, while continuing to make the minimum payment on all your debts. Who it may work for: If you want to see more accounts paid off ASAP, this may be the better strategy. It could also take some pressure off your finances because you'll juggle fewer monthly payments sooner. - Potential downsides: By the numbers alone, you might save less money with this method than you would with the avalanche strategy. - Learn more: Debt Snowball vs. Debt Avalanche Method 3. Consider Debt Consolidation By consolidating your debts, you may be able to lower your interest rate and streamline your monthly payments.
