government-issued photo ID or driver's license, proof of income such as pay stubs and tax returns, your employment and rent or mortgage history and recent bank statements. 4. Compare Loan Options Before you formally apply, get prequalified to see what rates you're eligible for through various lenders. To make comparing offers simpler, check out loans matched to your credit profile. Compare possible loan options, and be sure to take into account the total cost of the personal loan, which includes fees and interest charges. The APR you see alongside a loan is a good shorthand for checking the amount of monthly interest charges and upfront fees, such as origination fees, which are automatically deducted from the loan amount. Also check for other types of fees, including prepayment penalties, which can add to the cost of your loan. 5. Budget for Repayment Before you hit "apply," review your budget to determine how much you can afford in monthly payments. Taking on a debt with payments that stretch your budget thin can make it difficult to pay on time, which can place you under more financial pressure. Prioritizing on-time payments will help you avoid penalties and damage to your credit, if your lender reports to the bureaus. How to Establish Credit When You Have No Credit History Establishing credit and improving your score over time can help you reach a number of goalsâeverything from qualifying for a good credit card to renting an apartment to lowering your insurance premiums. If you're totally new to credit, here are tips to start building credit now. Become an Authorized User Asking a close and trusted family member or friend if you could be added as an authorized user on their credit card can be an entry point into building up your payment history. You'll build a history of managing accounts, which can help you qualify for a credit card on your own down the line to keep building credit independently. Open a Secured Credit Card A secured credit card is a type of card that requires you to put down a deposit. That deposit amount often serves as your credit limit. Like with any type of credit card, your monthly payments are reported to the credit bureaus to help you build up a positive payment history. After you've built up some credit history, you can graduate to a traditional credit card. Try Experian Goâ¢ Experian Goâ¢ is a free program that can help you create a credit report if you're currently credit invisible.
