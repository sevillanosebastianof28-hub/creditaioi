Clause 1, provides for Congress, not the courts, to regulate how states exercise their authority over Senate and House elections,15 although courts may hear cases concerning claims of one-person, one-vote violations and racial gerrymandering.16 For example, in its 2019 Rucho v. Common Cause decision, the Court held that partisan gerrymandering claims—claims that one political party has gerrymandered congressional districts to the disadvantage of the other party—are not justiciable by courts because “the only provision in the Constitution [Article I, Section 4, Clause 1] that specifically addresses the matter assigns it to the political branches” 17 and such claims present political questions— “outside the courts’ competence and therefore beyond the courts’ jurisdiction” —that are not for courts to decide.18 Although noting that the “districting plans at issue here are highly partisan, by any measure,” 19 the Rucho Court observed that partisan gerrymandering claims raise particular problems for courts to adjudicate. First, the Court noted that the Framers had expected partisan interests to inform how states drew district lines.20 Consequently, the Court reasoned that the problem is not whether partisan gerrymandering has occurred but when it has “gone too far.” 21 Second, the Court observed that there is no obvious standard by which to assess whether a partisan gerrymander has gone too far.22 The Court stated: “The initial difficulty in settling on a ‘clear manageable and politically neutral’ test for fairness is that it is not even clear what fairness looks like in this context. There is a large measure of ‘unfairness’ in any winner-take-all system.” 23 The Court in Rucho further emphasized that it did not condone partisan gerrymanders but that Congress is constitutionally authorized to address the issue.24 Likewise, in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, the Court upheld a state law providing for removing voters from voting roles based on indicators that they had moved, noting, among other things, that the state law was consistent with federal law and that the Court had “no authority to dismiss the considered judgment of Congress and the Ohio Legislature regarding the probative value of a registrant’s failure to send back a return card.” 25 In its 2023 Moore v. Harper decision, the Supreme Court held that the Elections Clause, in Article I, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, does not protect a state legislature from a state court reviewing whether the state legislature’s exercise of its Election Clause authority is consistent with its state constitution.26 Rejecting an argument that the Elections Clause insulated state legislatures from the “ordinary exercise of state judicial review,” 27 the Court observed: “State courts retain the authority to apply state constitutional restraints when legislatures act under the power conferred upon them by the Elections Clause.” 28 The Court, however, cautioned that state court power to review state rules regarding “[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives” was limited to “the ordinary bounds of judicial review” and that state courts should not “arrogate to themselves the power vested in state legislatures to regulate federal elections.” 29 The Court addressed what constitutes regulation by a state “Legislature” for purposes of the Elections Clause in its 2015 decision in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission.30 There, the Court rejected the Arizona legislature’s challenge to the validity of the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission (AIRC) and AIRC’s 2012 map of congressional districts.31 The Commission had been established by a 2000 ballot initiative, which removed redistricting authority from the legislature and vested it in the AIRC.32 The legislature asserted that this arrangement violated the Elections Clause because the Clause contemplates regulation by a state “Legislature” and “Legislature” means the state’s representative assembly.33 The Court disagreed and held that Arizona’s use of an independent commission to establish congressional districts is permissible because the Elections Clause uses the word “Legislature” to describe “the power that makes laws,” a
