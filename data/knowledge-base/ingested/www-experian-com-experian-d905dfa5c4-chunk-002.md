is to zero out your spending, with every dollar accounted for at the end of the month. Basic categories include essential and nonessential expenses, savings and debt payoff. However, you'll probably want to break these categories down in more detail. For example, you might budget $1,000 for rent, $120 for utilities, $323 for your car payment and so on. If you spend more than you've budgeted in one category, you'll need to stop spending or take money from another category to avoid going into the red. For instance, if you run out of grocery money, you could move funds from your entertainment budget to buy food. Zero-based budgeting can help you gain control of your money and stop overspending. However, it may be overwhelming if you're new to budgeting, and the rigid approach can be hard to stick with. Learn more: What Is a Zero-Based Budget? Envelope Budget An envelope budget works like a zero-based budget, except that you budget using physical cash. This method is also called cash stuffing because you sort cash into envelopes dedicated to different budget categories and spend only what's in the envelope for each category. When an envelope is empty, you can't spend any more in that category until your next pay period, unless you move cash from another envelope. Handling physical cash can make you more aware of your spending. However, budgeting in cash can be time-consuming, and carrying cash can be risky. Since many bills can't be paid with cash, you'll probably have to use cashless methods at least some of the time. Learn more: What Is Cash Stuffing? Pay-Yourself-First Budget A pay-yourself-first budget or reverse budget puts the focus on your savings and debt repayment goals. Whenever you get paid, your first priority is transferring money into savings or putting it toward your debt. After paying yourself, you can use the rest of your money as one big pool of funds. Just make sure you have all your necessary expenses covered before spending on nonessentials. The pay-yourself-first method can work well if you have a firm handle on your financial obligations and feel comfortable taking a flexible approach to managing your money. If you aren't careful, though, this approach could lead to overspending or accidentally overdrawing your checking account. Protect yourself with guardrails such as setting up spending alerts on your checking account or setting all your bills to autopay when you get paid.

"No-Budget" Budget A "no-budget" budget is a flexible spending plan that takes two things into account: Your net pay for the month - Your "must pays" for the month - Must-pays include things like rent, gas, groceries, utilities, debt payments and savings. Make sure you earmark enough money for these essentials, and you can treat everything else as disposable income, with no need to track nonessential spending. The no-budget budget is similar to the pay-yourself-first budget. Set up automatic transfers into your savings account as soon as you get paid so you know how much you have left to work with. You can also set up autopay for essential bills and set spending alerts to ensure you don't overdraw your checking account. Tip: The no-budget budget generally works best if you have a steady income and don't tend to overspend. It's less effective if you're an impulse buyer or have an irregular income. Why Is Budgeting Important? Budgeting is important because it helps you make the most of your money and reach your financial goals. Sticking to your budget ensures you can cover your bills and pay your debts. Budgeting can also help you reach short- and long-term financial goals like taking a vacation or buying a home. Without a budget, you're more likely to overdraw your bank account or overspend on your credit cards. You might
