26 Tips to Improve Credit in 2026 Quick Answer You can improve your credit score by making on-time payments, keeping balances low and limiting new credit applications. Find more tips for improving credit in 2026 below. Raising your credit scores can help you open the door to better financial opportunities. The higher your scores, the more access you'll have to the most favorable and least expensive borrowing options. And, beyond helping you qualify for loans, good credit can also reduce barriers to other financial goalsâlike renting an apartment or locking in lower insurance rates. For FICOÂ® ScoresÎ with a range of 300 to 850, a good credit score is generally considered one that falls between 670 and 739. Credit scores of 740 to 799 are very good, and scores 800 and above are considered excellent. If you're ready to commit to improving your credit in 2026, here are 26 ways to do it. 1. Put Holiday Windfalls Toward Debt If you're carrying balances that you've been having a difficult time paying off, you could use any windfalls that you receive this season to take a chunk out of your debt. Holiday bonuses and cash gifts from loved ones can be the gifts that keep on givingâif you use that cash to pay off high-interest debts. 2. Set Up Automatic Bill Payments The best way to avoid missing a monthly loan or credit card payment is to put your bills on autopay. Make sure you have enough money in your checking account to cover each bill to avoid an overdraft. When you know you won't have to deal with a sudden score dip after a forgotten bill, you can focus on other ways to improve credit. Learn more: How to Avoid Late Payments 3. Pay Down Balances The second most crucial component in your credit score is your credit utilization rate, and primarily how much revolving debt you're carrying compared with your total available credit. Make it a goal to reduce any high-interest credit card debt first, since that likely costs you more money in interest than, say, an auto loan or federal student loan does. Decreasing your credit card balances also shows potential lenders that you're responsible with credit. When your credit utilization approaches and climbs above 30% of your credit limit, it tends to have a greater negative effect on your scores; those with the highest credit scores usually have a utilization rate in the single digits. 4. Handle Debt in Collections If you currently have an unpaid debt that's gone to collections, consider negotiating it down or disputing the collection if you think it's an error. A debt in collections is likely more than three months past due, and either the original creditor or a debt collector may be contacting you very frequently to get its payment. You have the right to request that the debt collector stop contacting you, but it's in your best interest to deal with the debt: You may pay off the debt in full or work out a negotiated settlement with the lender. Ignoring the debt could mean wrecked credit and potentially a lawsuit, eventually leading to garnished wages or a lien against your property. Learn more: How Can I Find All My Debt? 5. Consider a Credit-Builder Loan If you're focused on building credit from scratch or recovering after a hit to your score, a credit-builder loan from a credit union could help. You'll make fixed payments for six to 24 months, and your money will sit in a savings account you'll be able to access at the end of the loan term. In the meantime, the lender will report your on-time payments to the credit bureaus, which could strengthen your score. Just make sure the lender reports to all three credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) for the best credit-building opportunity.
