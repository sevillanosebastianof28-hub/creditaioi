Does requesting my credit report hurt my credit score? English - Español - No, requesting your credit report does not hurt your credit score. You can check your credit at no charge at annualcreditreport.com . You can review your credit report online for free once a week, from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting companies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). You can request a copy of your credit report by mail once every 12 months from each of the three companies. And, until December 2026, you can use annualcreditreport.com to request as many as six free copies of your Equifax credit report during any twelve-month period. What are the consequences of checking my credit report? Checking your own credit report is not an inquiry about new credit, so it has no effect on your score. In fact, reviewing your credit report regularly can help you make sure the information the credit reporting companies share with lenders is accurate and up-to-date. Page last modified @
