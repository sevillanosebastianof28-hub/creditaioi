into collections). But there's a way around this.

Experian Go will then recommend the best ways for you to start building credit history, along with providing tools and insights. Common Mistakes to Avoid When Building Credit Young people who are brand new to credit can be vulnerable to making mistakes or believing credit myths that will actually set them back. Aim to avoid these common mistakes: Missing payments: Payment history is the biggest factor in your credit score, so even one credit card or loan payment made over 30 days late can lower your score. If you're consistently late or fall far behind on payments, your account might be sent to collections, which may also appear on your credit report. Late payments and collection accounts remain on your credit report for seven years and can hurt your credit during that time. Setting up automatic payments can help you avoid accidentally missing bills. - Forgetting closed accounts: Similarly, if you close an account that still has a balance, such as a utility or cable account when you move, make sure to pay off the balance. An unpaid bill could be sent to collections. - Accumulating excess credit card debt: You don't need to maintain a credit card balance to build creditâin fact, it's best to pay your bill in full each month to avoid interest. Access to credit cards might tempt you to buy things you otherwise couldn't afford, but that could land you deep in debt. When you can't pay the month's charges in full, you'll pay interest on the remaining balance. Depending on the card's interest rate, this can rapidly grow your balance, with your minimum payment making a minimal dent. Ideally, treat your credit card like a debit card, only using it for purchases you can pay off within a month. - Not paying balances in full: Besides avoiding interest, paying off your monthly credit card bill keeps your credit utilization low. This is how much of your available credit you're using at a given time, and it's an important factor in your credit score. To help your credit, experts recommend keeping your utilization ratio under 30%. For example, this means not carrying a balance above $300 on a card with a $1,000 limit. - Submitting frequent applications: When lenders review your loan or credit card application, they request a copy of your credit report, which results in a hard inquiry on your credit report. One hard inquiry can lower your credit scores slightly and temporarily, but multiple inquiries in a short time can increase the negative impact and cause you to appear financially risky. - Learn more: How Much Credit Card Debt Is Too Much? How Long Does It Take to Establish Credit? Your credit file is established as soon as your first credit account is reported to the credit bureaus (or if you use Experian Boost or Experian Go to get an Experian credit report). For most people, this is at age 18 or later, unless they had a credit report earlier due to being an authorized user. However, it can take up to six months of payment history to establish a credit score. Additionally, if you have fewer than five credit accounts, also known as having a thin file, lenders and credit scoring models may not
