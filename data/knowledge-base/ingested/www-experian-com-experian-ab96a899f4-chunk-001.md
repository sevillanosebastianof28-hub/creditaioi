How Does a Credit Score Simulator Work? Quick Answer Credit score simulators are interactive tools that predict how credit decisions will affect your credit score, based on the factors that impact scores. A credit score simulator is an interactive digital tool that predicts the effects that various scenarios can have on your credit score. These scenarios are related to your debts and payment decisions, such as paying down credit balances, placing a specific charge on one credit card or another, or opening a new loan or credit card account. Using a credit score simulator can help you predict the credit impact of actions you might take and aid in your decision making. Here's how they work. How a Credit Score Simulator Works Some credit score simulators take the form of questionnaires: They ask for information and use your answers to estimate a credit score. For instance, you can see the impact certain actions could have on your FICOÂ® ScoresÎ Estimator with the FICOÂ® Scores Estimator. This simulator estimates your score by asking 10 questions that cover the number of loans and credit card accounts you have, how long they've been open (or paid off), and your history of repaying them. Other simulators, such as those featured on websites that provide credit scores for free, base their estimates on an actual credit score, and then estimate how that score would change in various scenarios. The Experian FICOÂ® Score Simulator, available through an Experian membership, bases its calculations on your FICO 8 Score based on Experian data and shows how actions including the following might affect your score negatively or positively: Applying for a new credit card or loan - Projecting your current debt history ahead two years (to show the influence of age of accounts) - Making a bill payment 30 days or more late - Closing out one (or all) of your credit cards - Maxing out one (or all) of your credit cards - Filing bankruptcy - For example, this is what Experian's FICOÂ® Score Simulator might show you if you give it the scenario of missing a bill payment: How Your Credit Score Is Calculated The accuracy and sophistication of credit score simulators can vary, but all of them consider the multiple factors that influence your credit scores: Payment history: A track record of making debt payments on time benefits your credit scoresâand just one payment that goes unpaid for 30 days or longer can do significant harm to your scores. Payment history is responsible for about 35% of your FICOÂ® Score. - Amounts owed: The amount of outstanding debt you carry and your credit utilizationâthe percentage of credit you're using on revolving accounts represented by outstanding balancesâaccount for about 30% of your FICOÂ® Score. Carrying a balance on your credit cards can reduce your credit scores, with a 30% utilization on any credit card or other revolving account having a more severe effect. Individuals with excellent credit scores tend to keep utilization below 10%. - Length of credit history: A documented history managing credit can enhance your creditworthiness. All other factors being equal, your credit score will improve over time as the length of your credit history grows. Credit scoring systems factor in the age of your oldest loan or credit account, the age of your newest account and the average age of all accounts. Length of credit history is responsible for about 15% of your FICOÂ® Score. - Credit mix: Evidence that you can handle multiple debts and different forms of credit will tend to benefit your credit scores. Credit scoring systems favor a blend of credit types, such as installment debt (student loans, auto loans and mortgages, for instance) and revolving accounts (credit cards and lines of credit). Credit mix accounts for about 10% of your FICOÂ® Score. However, this doesn't mean it's a good
