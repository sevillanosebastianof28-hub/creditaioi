the card's credit-building features. - You'll make use of the card's rewards and redemption structure. Choose a card that aligns with your lifestyle: one that rewards you for dining if you often go to restaurants, or one that offers flat-rate cash back if you're not interested in keeping track of bonus categories. - You plan to pay off your balance in full each month. Cash back cards do, in essence, reward you for spending. But maintaining a large balance on your card, and carrying it over from month to month, will cost you money in interest and could hurt your credit. Plan to pay your balance in full so interest charges don't erode the rewards you earn, and so you keep your credit utilization rate low. - Learn more: What Credit Card Should I Get? How to Maximize Cash Back Rewards You can take a few steps to maximize the cash back rewards you'll earn. Make use of your card's bonus categories. If you have a tiered or rotating rewards card, be intentional about which card you use for each purchase. Having a note on your phone or stickers on individual cards with their bonus categories can help. - Keep an eye on extra earning opportunities. You may be eligible for limited-time offers to earn bonus cash back. Some cards, for example, provide double cash back on all purchases made in the first year of card ownershipâwhich means it could be wise to make large purchases early on. - Review the terms. Read over the credit card agreement to find out what doesn't count as an eligible purchase. For instance, you might not earn cash back if you use your credit card to buy lottery tickets or gift cards. You may also only earn cash back up to a maximum amount within certain categories. If you can choose between cash back and non-cash redemption options, review them closely to see which one will give you the best value. - Frequently Asked Questions The Bottom Line Cash back cards can lead to significant savings on everyday and major purchases, especially when you choose a card well-matched to your lifestyle.
