another term that sounds similar to APR, but the two are very different. More specifically, the term APY is an annualized percentage that represents how much interest you'll earn, or yield, on a deposit account, such as a high-yield savings account, certificate of deposit or interest-bearing checking account. Rather than incorporating fees associated with the deposit account, the APY accounts for compound interest you might earn. APR vs. APY Example Let's say you take out a personal loan of $15,000 with a 10% interest rate, a 5% origination fee and a three-year repayment term. Your loan's APR would be 13.39% (your interest charged plus the 5% origination fee, averaged over the life of your loan). Your total costs, including both interest and the upfront fee, will be $3,174.28. On the flip side, let's say you put $15,000 in a three-year certificate of deposit with a 5% interest rate that compounds monthly. Your APY will be 5.116%, and your total interest earnings will be $2,422.08. Compare personal loan rates Find APRs from 4.99% to 35.99% and flexible terms of 12 to 120 months. Loan amounts range from $1,000 up to $250,000, with funding available the same day or up to 7 days.

There are various factors that influence your APR, some of which you can control and others you can't. Loan Type and Lender Some loans naturally charge higher APRs than others. With a mortgage loan or auto loan, for instance, APRs are typically lower because you're using the home or car you're buying as collateral to secure the loan, which reduces the risk to the lender. In contrast, personal loans, credit cards and other unsecured loans typically charge higher APRs. You may also notice when comparing a certain type of loan that different lenders offer different rates. Each lender has its own criteria for evaluating creditworthiness and determining interest rates and fees, which is why it's crucial that you shop around before applying for a loan. Creditworthiness Borrowers with less-than-stellar credit profiles are statistically more likely to default on their debts, so a lender may charge a higher APR to compensate for that risk. In addition to your credit score, lenders will also consider your credit history and income. In particular, lenders look at your debt-to-income ratio (DTI)âthe percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward debt paymentsâto determine whether you can afford to take on more debt. A high DTI may result in a higher APR or denial of your application. With secured loans, such as auto and mortgage loans, they may also consider your collateral and down payment. Fees and Other Charges If a lender charges fees on top of your interest rate, they may be included in the APR, causing it to increase. Note, too, that some fees may not be included in your APR calculation. Ask your lender for a breakdown to make sure you fully understand your costs. Benchmark Rates Lenders use different benchmark indexes to calculate the rates they offer to borrowers. One example is the prime rate, which is directly influenced by the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate. The prime rate can impact the rate you'll get when you apply for new loans, but it won't impact your open accounts unless the APR is variable. How Is APR Calculated? In many cases, the rate lenders advertise is the APR, so you don't have to do any math to get the full picture of your costs. However, some loans may simply charge a fee instead of interest, and the APR isn't always easy to find. In this case, you can use an online APR calculator or run the numbers
