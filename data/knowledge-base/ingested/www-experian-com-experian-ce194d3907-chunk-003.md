Budget If you don't already have one, making a budget can help you get out of debt. A budget helps you pinpoint places where you might be able to cut back and allocate income toward paying your lenders. Choose a Budget System Finding a budget plan that works for you can help you stay on track. One option is the 50/30/20 budget rule: Earmark 50% of your net income for essentials, including housing, utilities, transportation, basic food and minimum debt payments. - Set aside 30% of your net income for affording your wants, including streaming subscriptions or eating out. - Use the remaining 20% to add to your savings and make extra payments toward your debt. - Limit Spending While leaving room for fun spending is important to avoid burnout, you could try pulling discretionary spending way back while you focus on bringing your debt down. For example, you might choose to cancel your gym membership and work out for free at home or cut back on the number of streaming services you use, with the understanding that you can add these back in once you've paid down your debt. You could also attempt a no-spend challenge. Use an App to Help Consider downloading a budgeting app to help you set goals and track your spending. Many apps automatically import and sort your spending into categories, which simplifies your bookkeeping and can help you recognize spending patterns. While some apps charge fees, there are also apps that you can use for free (such as Goodbudget). Learn more: Top Resources for Learning to Budget 5. Aim to Boost Your Income On top of adjusting your spending to prioritize repayment, making extra money can open up opportunities to put more toward your debt. Here are some ways you may be able to increase your income: Freelance to make money with the skills you already have. - Sell things online, such as crafts or old clothes and electronics. - Try gig work, such as walking dogs, tutoring or driving for a rideshare service. - Ask for a raise at work when the timing is right. - However you bring in extra cash, funnel the money into paying down debt.

Here are some ways to keep yourself on track for the long haul: Break your goal into pieces. Small, achievable goals can help you stay motivated and on track. For example, you might aim to pay an extra $50 or $100 toward your debt per paycheck. You can also set milestone goals, such as paying off your debt with the smallest balance in three months. - Treat yourself. Coming up with a reward system can help you stay locked in. For example, if you're paying down a $2,000 personal loan, you could reward yourself with a small treat for every $200 you pay off. Just be sure the rewards you pick are within your budget to avoid derailing your progress. - Find accountability. There are a lot of ways to find accountability. One idea is to look for an accountability partner, or someone you can share your goals and progress with. If they're working toward their own financial goals, you could offer each other support. There are also accountability apps that can help you find motivation. - 7. Consider Credit Counseling Getting a professional's perspective on how to approach your debt payoff goals can help you feel more confident that you're on the right track. A nonprofit credit counselor can review your finances with you to come up with a realistic plan for navigating your financial situation and paying off debt.
