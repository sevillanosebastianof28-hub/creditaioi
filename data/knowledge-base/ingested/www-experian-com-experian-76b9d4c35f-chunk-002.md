years. The extended fraud alert instructs creditors to contact you by phone or in person before issuing credit in your name. - Active-duty alert: Only available to active-duty service members, these alerts expire after a year and ask creditors to have a reasonable belief that they know the identity of the person making a request. - You can also renew initial, active-duty and extended fraud alerts up to three months before they expire. But for active-duty and extended fraud alerts, you may need to resubmit verification documents proving that you qualify for the alert. Even if you don't add a fraud alert to your credit report, you can opt out of receiving prescreened offers for credit and insurance on OptOutPrescreen.com. But some people prefer receiving these offers as they might get offers that aren't available to the general public.

It can help stop credit fraud because creditors that want to check your credit as part of an application review process won't be allowed access to your credit report. Unlike the various types of fraud alerts, you'll need to unfreeze, or thaw, your credit reports if you want to apply for credit with a freeze in place. Additionally, you'll need to freeze and unfreeze each of your credit reports individually. Fraud alerts and credit freezes can both be helpful, but compare and understand what they doâand what they don't doâbefore adding them to your credit reports.

In general, it makes sense to place a fraud alert if you believe you are or may become the victim of credit fraud or identity theft. More specifically, you might want to add a fraud alert to your credit after: Your information was compromised in a data breach - Your wallet or documents with personal information were lost or stolen - You suspect someone is using your identity - You're an active-duty service member - You reported identity theft or credit fraud to the police or FTC - Considering recent data breaches have exposed potentially billions of Social Security numbers, it may be safe to assume that fraudsters and scammers may have access to your personal information. You can also place a fraud alert and freeze your credit if you want extra protection. And although managing freezes can be more work, they might provide more protection than a fraud alert.
