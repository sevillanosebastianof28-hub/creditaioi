Phone SIM swapping is when someone temporarily takes over your phone line using the same SIM swapping procedure that you'd use to activate a new phone. Criminals do this by tricking or paying off mobile phone carriers' employees. Alternatively, they might port your number to a phone they control at a different carrier. Once they take control of your number, they can have your text message MFA codes sent to a phone they control. The potential for porting and SIM swapping is why SMS-based MFA can be less secure than other options. However, mobile phone carriers now offer extra security measures that can help protect you from SIM swapping attacks. Look online or contact your carrier to find out what you need to do to enable them. 4. Monitor Your Accounts Keep an eye on your bank, investment, crypto and credit card accounts for any unusual activity. You generally aren't liable for unauthorized credit or debit purchases, but you may need to act quickly and call the financial institution to dispute the transactions. If you notice a new account was opened in your name, the company can also help you close the account. In some situations, your liability could depend on how long you take to report the fraud. You could be liable for up to $50 if you take up to two business days, or up to $500 if you wait longer. If more than 60 days go by, you could be responsible for the full amount of new unauthorized transactions. You may also want to monitor other accounts that criminals could break into and monetize; for example, ecommerce accounts where you store credit or payment information, or even loyalty travel programs that criminals take over to book hotels and flights. Your rights and protections can depend on how the fraudsters get into your accounts and what they steal. Some organizations might reimburse you, but you won't always have legal recourse if they don't. 5. Report the Theft of Your Personal and Account Information Reporting unauthorized transactions and other types of fraud to financial institutions and other affected organizations is important. Additionally, you can report the theft or fraud to: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC): Follow the instructions on IdentityTheft.gov to report that your information was exposed in a data breach or that someone has your information and you're worried about identity theft. The FTC can create a personalized recovery plan for you and an FTC Identity Theft Report that you can use when reaching out to other organizations. - Local police departments: You may want to report identity theft or fraud to your local police department. The police report might be helpful when you're dealing with other organizations, and some police departments have been able to track down and prosecute fraudsters. - Credit bureaus: You have the right to dispute the items on your credit report. If fraudulent activity led to new accounts or negative marks in your credit reports, you can submit a dispute to address the erroneous information. - Identity theft protection services: If you have an identity theft protection service, you may have access to identity theft resolution professionals who can help you contact organizations, get your documents in order and manage the restoration process. You may also have identity theft insurance, which can help cover costs related to resolving all these issues. - 6. Freeze Your Credit You also have the right to add a security freeze to your credit reports from Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. This is also called freezing your credit, and it can be a simple and free way to keep someone from opening new credit accounts in your name. You have to freeze your reports separately at each credit bureau, which you can do online, over the phone or by mail. Experian | TransUnion | Equifax | ---|---|---| Experian Security
