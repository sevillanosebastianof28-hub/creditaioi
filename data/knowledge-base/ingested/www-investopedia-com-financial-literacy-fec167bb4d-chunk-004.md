to any of these factors but are indirectly influenced by their current levels and consensus predictions on how they will trend in the near future. Mortgage rates are determined by a complex interaction of macroeconomic and industry factors, such as: The level and direction of the bond market, especially 10-year Treasury yields The Federal Reserve's current monetary policy, especially as it relates to bond buying and funding government-backed mortgages Competition between mortgage lenders and across loan types Because any number of these can cause fluctuations simultaneously, it's generally difficult to attribute the change to any one factor. Macroeconomic factors kept the mortgage market relatively low for much of 2021. In particular, the Federal Reserve had been buying billions of dollars of bonds in response to the pandemic's economic pressures. This bond-buying policy is a major influencer of mortgage rates. But starting in November 2021, the Fed began tapering its bond purchases downward, making sizable monthly reductions until reaching net zero in March 2022. Between that time and July 2023, the Fed aggressively raised the federal funds rate to fight decades-high inflation. While the fed funds rate can influence mortgage rates, it doesn't directly do so. In fact, the fed funds rate and mortgage rates can move in opposite directions. But given the historic speed and magnitude of the Fed's 2022 and 2023 rate increases—raising the benchmark rate 5.25 percentage points over 16 months—even the indirect influence of the fed funds rate has resulted in a dramatic upward impact on mortgage rates over the last two years. The Fed maintained the federal funds rate at its peak level for almost 14 months, beginning in July 2023. But on Sept. 18, the central bank announced the first rate cut in what was expected to be a series of decreases in 2024 and into 2025. This first reduction was by 0.50 percentage points, and the second and third cuts were 0.25% each in November and December. Up to three rate cuts are expected in 2025, but the Fed held rates steady at its most recent meeting on June 18. The Fed's next rate announcement will be made on July 30. The first thing I'd suggest is thinking about what type of mortgage you're looking for—whether it’s for a new home or refinancing. Depending on your financial situation, you might need to consider different loan options, and if you're able to, offering a larger down payment can help secure a lower interest rate. Definitely take the time to shop around and compare lenders. Having a good idea of your credit score will give you a better sense of what rates you can expect. If you already have a relationship with a bank or credit union, it's a great idea to start there since they may offer better rates or terms to keep your business. Also, consider how long you plan to stay in the home and whether you'd prefer a fixed- or variable-rate mortgage, as both can affect your overall costs. Taking the time to explore all your options can make a big difference in getting the best mortgage rate for your situation! - Taylor Kovar, a member of Investopedia’s Financial Advisor Council What Is a Mortgage and How Does It Work? A mortgage is a legal contract between a borrower and a lender, such as a bank or credit union, that's typically used for the purchase or refinancing of a home or other form of real estate. The lender makes a certain sum of money available, which the borrower agrees to pay back, along with interest, in regular monthly payments over a specified term, such as 30 years. In the meantime, the property serves as collateral for the loan, and the lender has a legal right to seize and sell it of the borrower fails to make the required payments. In most instances,
