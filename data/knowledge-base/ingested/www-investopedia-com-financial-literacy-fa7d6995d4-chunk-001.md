With the right strategy and responsible spending, credit cards can help you build credit, earn rewards, and more. Learn how credit cards work, what interest rates they charge, and how to use your cards in smart and effective ways. You can complete a credit card application in several ways: online, on a paper application, or on the phone. Applying for a credit card online is convenient and you can get a decision almost immediately. Be prepared with personal details like your date of birth and social security number; details on income and housing costs; and information on any authorized users you want to add to the account. Credit card approval can often be obtained instantly online but getting the plastic in your hands is another matter. If you are in a particular hurry many issuers can ship your card for overnight delivery, but at a significant cost. Otherwise it generally takes 3 - 10 business days to get your new credit card through the U.S. mail. Credit card issuers determine each cardholder’s credit limit based on many factors, the most important of which is the customer’s credit score. Other factors typically include employment status, income level and debt to income ratio. Whether credit limits are a set dollar amount or are dynamic, i.e. not pre-set, the creditworthiness of the borrower is the most important consideration for lenders in determining how much credit to extend. Very often it is quite possible to lower the interest rate on your credit card account if you contact your card issuer’s customer service department with the request. Your account must be in good standing to be eligible for an interest rate adjustment, however, which means you have not been late with previous payments or exceeded your credit limit. Credit card disputes typically arise when consumers unsuccessfully attempt to get a refund from a merchant for unwanted or defective merchandise or they notice an unauthorized charge on their credit card statement. In these cases the customer should contact their card issuer to dispute a charge either online or by calling the toll-free number on the back of their card. A credit card is a small plastic payment device connected to a revolving credit account issued by a financial services company or national bank that is accepted by network merchants for the purchase of goods and services. Credit cards typically feature an embossed account number, expiration date and cardmember name on the front of the card along with the payment network logo, security chip and card issuer name. The back of a credit card features a magnetic strip, holographic network logo and security number along with customer service numbers to contact in case of loss or theft. A credit card balance is the sum total of all the charges made during the current billing cycle in addition to any balances that were carried forward from previous billing periods. Credit card balances can not exceed the credit limit on the account. The ratio of credit card balances to the credit limit determines the level of utilization of the account, which is factored into the calculation of the individual’s credit score. Credit card debt is the unsecured liability that is incurred by a consumer when they carry balances forward past the due date. Revolving credit card debt is subject to minimum payments of approximately 3-5% of the total balance each month and is subject to the regular interest rate on the account unless promotional or penalty rates are in effect. The minimum monthly payment on a credit card account is the greater of either a stated percentage of outstanding balances (typically 3-5%, depending on the issuer) or a fixed dollar amount (typically $5 - $10). Cardholders must make at least the minimum payment due each month on their account in order to keep it in good standing. Balances that
