When You Get Married, Do You Share Debt? Quick Answer The assets and debts you enter marriage with typically remain your own separate property. If you live in a common-law state, debts accrued during marriage could remain separate. In a community property state, both spouses may legally be equally responsible. When you get married, you're signing up for a partnership that involves creating a home as a pair and working together toward shared goals. However, one thing you might not look forward to sharing upon marriage is each other's debts. Any assets or debts you enter a marriage with are considered your own separate property forever, unless you commingle them with shared funds or add your spouse to an account. However, whether or not you're responsible for your spouse's debt incurred after marriage depends on the state where you live and whether you co-borrowed the debt. Here's what you need to know. Am I Responsible for My Spouse's Debt? Debts you and your spouse incurred before marriage remain your own individual obligations. Exactly how spouses share responsibility for new debts taken on after marriage depends in part on state laws and the type of debt. You are usually responsible for your spouse's debts accrued after marriage if you became joint account owners or co-borrowed a loan with your spouse, either before or after marriage. Let's cover exactly when you're legally responsible for debts incurred before and after marriage. Do You Inherit Your Spouse's Debt When You Get Married? If your spouse accumulated debt before marriage, and you didn't cosign, co-borrow or become a joint account holder, those debts don't become shared responsibilities after the wedding. They remain your spouse's personal debt and sole responsibility, even if you live in a community property state. If you cosigned on the debt, however, and your spouse doesn't pay, you are legally required to repay that debt even after marriage. The only times you would be responsible for debt your spouse incurred before marriage would be if, after marriage, you sign on to be a joint account holder or you co-borrow a loan. For example, if your spouse had a personal credit card with debt, then added you to the account as a joint owner after the marriage, it's possible you'd be equally responsible. Loans taken out jointly, such as for a house or car, remain both your financial responsibilities. But the nuances can vary by state. Learn more: Co-Borrower vs. Cosigner: What's the Difference? Do You Share Debt Incurred During Marriage? Debt that's obtained during a marriage is treated differently depending on whether your state abides by common law or community property law. Even if you and your spouse keep your finances separate, the state law has the final say on who owns what. Note that in this context, "property" is a legal term that isn't limited to real estate or tangible goods; it also means debts, earnings and financial assets. How Common-Law States Handle Debt After Marriage Most states use common law (also known as equitable distribution), which dictates that married couples don't automatically share personal property legally. In other words, you aren't responsible for your spouse's debt unless you took it out together as a joint account, or you cosigned on it. There are a few exceptions. While personal debt remains each spouse's individual liability, both spouses usually share responsibility for debts for family essentials that benefit them equally. This could include housing, food and tuition for children's schools. Requirements vary by state, so check your state's laws or consult a local attorney. Individual debt, including credit card accounts and loans, is in the name of one spouse only. That person is generally held solely responsible for repaying it, so the spouse whose name isn't on the debt is protected. Joint debt may be incurred during marriage in a common-law state
