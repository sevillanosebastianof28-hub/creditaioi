AnnualCreditReport.com. - Which type of loan is better for you? HELOC vs. Second Mortgage Choosing the right home equity financing depends entirely on your unique situation. Typically, HELOCs will have lower interest rates and greater payment flexibility, but if you need all the money at once, a home equity loan is better. If you are trying to decide, think about the purpose of the financing. Are you borrowing so you'll have funds available as spending needs arise over time, or do you need a lump sum now to pay for something like a kitchen renovation? A home equity loan offers borrowers a lump sum with an interest rate that is fixed, but tends to be higher. HELOCs, on the other hand, offer access to cash on an as-needed basis, but often come with an interest rate that can fluctuate. As a borrower, it pays to shop around and ask a lot of questions to ensure that you are getting the right financing for your needs at the best interest rate possible.
