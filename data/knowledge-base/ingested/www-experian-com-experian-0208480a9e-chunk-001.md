What Is an Emergency Fund? Quick Answer An emergency fund is a savings account reserved for unforeseen expenses or financial crises, such as job loss. Having cash in a bank account that you can easily draw from helps you avoid taking on debt in times of hardship. An emergency fund is a pool of cash reserves set aside specifically for future financial crises or unplanned expenses. Maintaining an emergency fund lets you avoid relying on credit cards or loans during periods of financial hardship, which can turn one-time bills into ongoing, interest-bearing debt. Here's what to know about an emergency fund, and how you can start one. What Is an Emergency Fund? An emergency fund is a pool of money you can draw on to pay for surprise expenses, like unplanned medical bills, or to keep you afloat during difficult life events, such as a layoff or divorce. Ideally, you'll keep an emergency fund separate from the bank accounts you use for daily financial transactions, and you'll ensure the account is funded at all times (more on how much to keep in your emergency fund below). Saving for emergencies in advance is a proactive way to give yourself the gift of greater financial security. It also gives you the freedom to make choicesâsuch as leaving a relationship or agreeing to a medical procedureâthat can truly impact your quality of life.

It's crucial to have an emergency fund to address financial setbacks, avoid taking on debt and minimize the long-term impact of a financial crisis. Here are some common expenses that an emergency fund can help cover: Unexpected medical costs: Even if you have health insurance, you may receive a large hospital bill you didn't see coming. Or you may need to pay for a medical procedure that your insurance covers only partially, or not at all. - Job loss: If you suddenly lose your job, an emergency fund can help you pay bills until you find a new one. - Car repairs: Particularly if you rely on your car to get to work every day, car repairs can be urgentâand costly, in the case of a new transmission or engine replacement. - Home repairs and other costs: A leaky roof, broken refrigerator or other home emergency can be expensive and inconvenient, requiring quick action. Homeowners insurance will likely cover some home repairs (depending on circumstances), but you may also have to chip in, depending on the insurance policy and the issue. - In short, use your emergency fund for any expense that is unexpected, urgent and absolutely necessary. Tip: Avoid taking money out of your emergency fund to pay for a vacation, buy gifts, lend money to someone or cover ongoing, anticipated expenses. An account for specific upcoming costs, called a sinking fund, would be a better choice in these cases. How Much Should Be in an Emergency Fund? Experts suggest saving three to six months' worth of basic living expenses in an emergency fund. To do that, tally up your monthly necessities, such as your rent or mortgage payment, groceries, utilities, minimum debt payments and insurance. Multiply that by the number of months' worth of expenses you want to save. That's your goal, and it's OK if it takes a while for your account to be fully funded. You may decide to save more than six months of expenses if you're the sole earner in your household, you have an irregular income or you work as a freelancer. Where Should I Keep My Emergency Fund?
