Administrative adjudication proceedings Administrative adjudication proceedings are formal adversarial proceedings conducted by an administrative law judge, who issues a recommended decision to the CFPB director. The director issues a final decision, either adopting or modifying the administrative law judge’s recommended decision. The Bureau initiates an administrative adjudication proceeding by filing a Notice of Charges alleging a violation of a consumer protection statute. Unlike cases filed in federal court, administrative adjudication proceedings take place before an administrative agency tribunal. An administrative law judge presides over administrative adjudication proceedings in a fair, impartial, and expeditious manner and has a role similar to that of a trial judge. These proceedings operate in a manner similar to bench trials in federal district courts, although administrative adjudication proceedings have some differences including their evidentiary rules. The Office of Administrative Adjudication (OAA) maintains the official public record of all administrative proceedings. Proceedings are conducted in accordance with the Rules of Practice for Adjudication Proceedings. Our docket The docket includes all public documents filed in administrative proceedings before the Office of Administrative Adjudication. Forms and information for parties of administrative proceedings Access forms and further information about the administrative adjudication process and proceedings before the administrative law judge. Administrative law judges Administrative law judges (ALJs) serve as independent, impartial triers of fact in formal proceedings requiring a decision on the record. Administrative law judges conduct formal hearings involving cases where all interested parties are given advance notice of a hearing; an opportunity to submit facts, arguments, offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment; and an opportunity to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel or other qualified representatives. Administrative law judges at the Bureau are not subject to the supervision or direction of, or responsible to, any officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for the Bureau. Administrative law judges are appointed for life under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq., through a procedure administered by the Office of Personnel Management. Administrative law judges have complete judicial independence from the Bureau. Administrative law judge authority The authority of United States administrative law judges comes from the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq. The APA is designed to guarantee the decisional independence of administrative law judges and ensure fairness in administrative proceedings before federal government agencies. All direction and questions by the Bureau to the administrative law judge concerning any adjudication proceeding must appear in and be a part of the record. 12 C.F.R. § 1081.105(b). Administrative law judges are not rated by, evaluated, or given bonuses for their performance by any official of the Bureau. Bureau officials may not interfere with administrative law judges’ decision making, and administrative law judges may be discharged only for good cause established based upon a complaint filed with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and determined after an APA hearing on the record before an MSPB judge. Administrative law judge powers The powers of an administrative law judge include the power: To administer oaths and affirmations - To issue subpoenas, subpoenas duces tecum, and protective orders, and quash or modify any such subpoenas or orders - To take depositions or cause depositions to be taken - To receive and rule upon the admission of evidence - To regulate the course of a proceeding and the conduct of parties and their counsel - To rule on the admissibility and confidentiality of written submissions - To conduct conferences for settlement, simplification of issues, or any other proper purpose - To inform parties of the availability of alternative means of dispute resolution and encourage use of such methods - To certify questions to the director for his or her determination in accordance with the rules of practice for adjudication proceedings - To consider and rule upon all procedural
