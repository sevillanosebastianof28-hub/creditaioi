and single-owner history are generally positive signs. Be especially cautious of vehicles that have changed hands frequently or were previously used as rental cars or taxis, as it could cause additional wear on the car. 9. Negotiate the Price With no manufacturer's suggested retail price on used cars, there's often room to negotiate. Use your researchâincluding the vehicle's estimated value, comparable listings and any issues found during the inspectionâto support your offer. Be prepared to walk away if the dealer won't meet a price you're comfortable with. If you have a vehicle to trade in, research its trade-in value separately so you can negotiate each transaction independently. Learn more: How to Negotiate the Price of a Car 10. Finalize the Purchase Once you've agreed on a price, the dealer will handle most of the paperwork, including the title transfer and registration. Review all documents carefully before signing, and make sure the final price matches what you agreed to. Be prepared for the finance office to offer add-ons like extended warranties, gap insurance and paint protection. Many of these products or services are often overpriced and unnecessary. Take time to research any add-ons before agreeing to purchase them. How to Buy a Used Car From a Private Seller Buying from a private seller often means lower prices, but it also requires more effort on your part. Here's how to navigate the process. 1. Verify the Seller and Car Details Before meeting in person, do some homework. Ask for the VIN and run a vehicle history report to check for accidents, title issues or odometer discrepancies. Verify that the name on the title matches the seller's identification. Be wary of sellers who are reluctant to share details or seem evasive about the car's history. Trust your instincts: If something feels off, move on to another listing. 2. Choose a Safe Place to Meet For your safety, arrange to meet the seller in a public location during daylight hours. Many police stations offer designated parking spots for online transactions, which can provide added security for both parties. Bring a friend or family member with you, and let someone else know where you're going and when you expect to return. 3. Ask to Test Drive the Car A test drive is just as important when buying from a private seller. Make sure the seller has valid insurance before driving, and bring your own insurance information in case it's needed. Drive on different road types to evaluate performance, and don't rush. Take your time to get a feel for the vehicle. 4. Inspect the Car Thoroughly Conduct a detailed inspection of the vehicle's exterior, interior and mechanical components. Use the checklist from the earlier section to guide your evaluation. Since private sellers typically don't recondition vehicles before selling, you may find more issues than you would at a dealership. Factor any necessary repairs into your offer. If you're satisfied with what you see, arrange for an independent mechanic to inspect the vehicle before you commit to buying. Some mechanics offer mobile inspections, while others may require you to bring the car to their shop. If the seller refuses to allow an inspection, consider it a major red flag. 5. Negotiate the Price Private sellers often have more flexibility on price than dealers. Use your research and inspection findings to justify your offer. Be respectful but firm. If you can't reach an agreement, it's OK to walk away. There are plenty of other cars on the market. 6. Make an Offer Using a Secure Payment Method Once you've agreed on a price, use a secure payment method. For large transactions, a cashier's check from your bank is generally the safest option. Avoid paying with cash if possible, and never agree to wire money to a sellerâthis is a common scam. If the seller is willing, consider
