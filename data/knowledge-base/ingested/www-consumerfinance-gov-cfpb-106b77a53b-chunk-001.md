Supervisory Highlights We periodically publish Supervisory Highlights to share key examination findings. These reports also communicate operational changes to our supervision program and provide a convenient and easily accessible resource for information on our recent guidance documents. Supervisory Highlights do not refer to any specific institution in order to maintain the confidentiality of supervised entities, but share key findings in order to help industry limit risks to consumers and comply with federal consumer financial law. Each Supervisory Highlights publication shares recent examination findings, including information about recent enforcement actions that resulted, at least in part, from our supervisory work. 2024 Winter Supervisory Highlights Issue 36 topics: Supervision, UDAAPs, Deceptive Practices, Auto Loans Issue 37 topics: Supervision, UDAAPs, Deceptive Practices Fall Supervisory Highlights Issue 35 topics: Supervision, UDAAPs, Deceptive Practices, Auto Loans Summer Supervisory Highlights Issue 34 topics: Credit Card Account Management, Deceptive Practices, Debt Collection, Student Loan Servicing, Supervision, UDAAPs Spring Supervisory Highlights Issue 32 topics: Fair Credit Reporting Act, Supervision, Credit Reports and Scores, and Identity Theft Issue 33 topics: Mortgage Servicing, UDAAPs, Supervision, Deceptive Practices, and Mortgages 2023 Fall Supervisory Highlights Junk Fees Update Special Edition Topics: Overdrafts, Auto loans, UDAAPs, Remittances Summer Supervisory Highlights Topics: Auto Loans, Debt Collection, Mortgage Servicing, Mortgages, Payday Loans, Deceptive Practices, Supervision Supervisory Highlights Junk Fees Special Edition Topics: Supervision, Debt Collection, Mortgage Servicing, Credit Card Account Management, Deposits, UDAAPs 2022 Fall Supervisory Highlights Topics: Auto Servicing, Consumer Reporting, Credit Card Account Management, Debt Collection, Deposits, Mortgage Origination, Mortgage Servicing, Payday Lending, UDAAP Spring Supervisory Highlights Topics: Debt Collection, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Auto Loans, Student Loans, Credit Cards, Supervision, Money Transfers, Deceptive Practices, Mortgages 2021 Fall Supervisory Highlights Topics: Supervision, Debt Collection, Prepaid Cards, Mortgage Servicing, Credit Card Account Management, Deposits, Fair Lending, Payday Lending, Remittances, UDAAPs Summer Supervisory Highlights Topics: Supervision, Mortgage Origination, Payday Loans, Mortgage Servicing, Debt Collection COVID-19 Prioritized Assessments Special Edition (Issue 23) Topics: Supervision, Debt Collection, Prepaid Cards, Mortgage Servicing, Auto Servicing, Student Loan Servicing, Credit Card Account Management, Consumer Reporting, Furnishing, Deposits, Small Business Lending 2020 Winter Supervisory Highlights Topics: Supervision, debt collection, mortgage servicing, payday loans, student loans, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, RESPA, ECOA, TILA Summer Supervisory Highlights Topics: Supervision, debt collection, fair lending, money transfers, mortgage servicing, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, HMDA 2019 Supervisory Highlights Consumer Reporting Special Edition Topics: Fair Credit Reporting Act, Supervision, credit reports and scores, identity theft and fraud, debt collection, banking, financial service providers Summer Supervisory Highlights Topics: UDAAPs, auto loans, Supervision, compliance, credit cards, credit reports and scores, debt collection, Fair Credit Reporting Act, mortgage origination Winter Supervisory Highlights Topics: UDAAPs, small dollar loans, auto loans, mortgage servicing, deposits, remittances, Supervision, Enforcement, HMDA 2018 Summer Supervisory Highlights Topics: credit cards, UDAAPs, fair lending, small business lending, small-dollar loans, auto loans, ECOA, mortgage servicing, supervision, debt collection, enforcement, HMDA 2017 Summer Supervisory Highlights Topics: auto loans, compliance, credit cards, debt collection, enforcement, fair lending, HMDA, Know Before You Owe, mortgages, overdrafts, payday loans, supervision Spring Supervisory Highlights Topics: mortgage originations, mortgage servicing, fair lending, supervision, and student loans Supervisory Highlights Consumer Reporting Special Edition Topic: consumer reporting 2016 Fall Supervisory Highlights Topics: auto loan origination, auto loan servicing, debt collection, mortgage origination, student loan servicing, fair lending, reverse mortgages, supervision Summer Supervisory Highlights Topics: auto origination, debt collection, mortgage origination, small-dollar lending, and fair lending Supervisory Highlights Mortgage Servicing Special Edition Topics: foreclosures and mortgage servicing Winter Supervisory Highlights Topics: mortgage, debt collection, remittances, credit reporting, and student loans 2015 Fall Supervisory Highlights Topics: consumer reporting, debt collection, mortgage origination, mortgage servicing, student loan servicing, and fair lending Summer Supervisory Highlights Topics: mortgage servicing, mortgage origination, consumer reporting, debt collection, fair lending, deposits Winter Supervisory Highlights Topics: consumer reporting, debt collection, deposits, mortgage origination, Fair Lending, recent
