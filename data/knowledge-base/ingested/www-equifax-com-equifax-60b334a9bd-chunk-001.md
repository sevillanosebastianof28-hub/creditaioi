Password Safety: Are Yours Secure Enough? Highlights: Passwords are one of the most common ways hackers break into computers and swipe personal data - Reusing passwords, even with slight variations, on different sites may not be secure enough - Strong passwords are long, complex and have a variety of different characters - Most of us have seen the message pop up more than once: “your password needs to be at least 8 characters long,” or something similar. It might make you roll your eyes, but remember: passwords need to be strong in order to help secure your personal information -- including emails and files. Most people know the risks of flimsy passwords. But even knowing the risks hasn’t necessarily changed our behavior. In 2018, for the fifth consecutive year, “123456” and “password” topped the list of the worst passwords of the year, released annually by password management provider Splash Data. Unfortunately, passwords continue to be one of the most common ways hackers break into computers and personal data. By guessing passwords, hackers can give themselves an all-access pass to your financial accounts, personal documents and files, and possibly your other devices – especially if you reuse passwords across different sites. It’s no surprise we do reuse them, given the number of sites requiring a login with a password. More than half – 60 percent -- of 3,000 adults surveyed by Google and Harris Poll said they have too many passwords to remember. And 65 percent of respondents to the survey, released in early 2019, said they reuse the same passwords for multiple accounts. Even using a slight variation on the same password may not make it harder for hackers, and they may be counting on us to take the easy way out. Reusing passwords, even with slight variations, is like moving your house key from under the doormat to under a flower pot: it may not be secure enough. If a hacker can access your personal data, they may be able to steal your money – or your identity. If you’re a business owner, cyber criminals can sneak into your data and access client and customer information. So where do you start? Here are some suggestions for creating and storing passwords: Creating a strong password 1. Make it memorable – for you. You can come up with a phrase and turn it into a password by only using the first two digits or first digit of each word: Example: “My first concert was Blink-182 in Los Angeles. Tickets were only $15” Password: MyficowaBl182inLoAnTiweon$15. 2. Make it unique. Use a different password for every important online account you have, such as bank accounts, credit card, and emails. If you can, use a different password for every single account. One way to make it easy to keep track of each password is to use the first letter of the channel or website to begin the password, or something similar so you can easily relate it to each account. 3. Make it longer. Longer passwords are stronger and much harder for hackers to guess. Use a “pass phrase” you would remember that no one else would. It could be a string of seemingly random words with numbers and symbols, like oneDay2WeCan$G0totheM00n. Aim for at least 16 characters. 4. Avoid personal information and common words. As you create longer passwords, remember to avoid using personal information like nicknames, names of children or pets, birthdays, or address information. Also avoid common words such as “letmein” or “password,” and avoid keyboard patterns like “qwerty.” 5. Make it complex. Including upper and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers are all ways you can make your passwords more complex and harder to guess or hack. Avoid using words that could be found in a dictionary. You can try breaking up a word with a special character or string
