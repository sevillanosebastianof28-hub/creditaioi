Can You Get a Personal Loan With a Cosigner? Quick Answer Yes, you can get a personal loan with a cosigner. Having a cosigner could help you qualify for the loan, get a better interest rate and secure a larger loan amount. A personal loan can provide quick cash that you can use for just about anything, from covering a financial emergency to consolidating debt. It's possible to apply for a personal loan with a cosigner. Doing so might improve your eligibility, increase your borrowing power and help you qualify for a better rate. It can be an important step if you're applying for a personal loan with bad credit. What Does a Cosigner Do? A cosigner is someone who agrees to take responsibility for the loan if the main borrower fails to make their payments as promised. They're essentially vouching for the primary borrower and putting their own credit on the line. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. If the borrower makes good on their loan payments, it can help improve their own credit score and strengthen their cosigner's credit as well. Below are the responsibilities of a personal loan cosigner: If the application is approved, they agree to take equal responsibility for the primary borrower's personal loan debt. - The loan will then be added to the cosigner's credit report. The same goes for the primary borrower. - The primary borrower is responsible for making regular loan payments, but the cosigner will not have access to loan funds. - If the primary borrower stops making their payments, the cosigner will be responsible for stepping in and repaying the loan. - Compare personal loan rates Find APRs from 4.99% to 35.99% and flexible terms of 12 to 120 months.

Cosigner vs. Co-Borrower A cosigner is not the same as a co-borrower. The latter is a co-applicant who has a shared interest in the loan. That means they have equal ownership and will have access to the loan funds. They're also equally responsible for making loan payments. Both names will appear on the personal loan documents. Applying for a personal loan with a co-borrower might improve your chances of getting approved. That's because the lender will consider both of your credit scores, incomes and debt-to-income ratios (DTIs). Your DTI shows lenders how much of your monthly income is going toward debt payments. You may need a DTI that's below 36% to qualify for a personal loan with a reasonable interest rate, though some lenders may have looser requirements. Applying with a co-borrower might also give the lender extra reassurance because two people are responsible for repaying the loan, which could reduce the likelihood of a default.
