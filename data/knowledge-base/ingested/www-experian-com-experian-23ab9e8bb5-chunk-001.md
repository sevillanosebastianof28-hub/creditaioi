How Long Does It Take to Build Credit? Quick Answer It can take several months to establish your credit score from scratch, and several years after that to continue to build and maintain a solid credit history. If you don't have a credit historyâor a history of borrowing money and paying it backâit can take several months to establish a credit score. Having a credit score is an important part of building credit, but it's just the beginning. Here's what you need to know about the credit-building process, including how long it takes, how your score is calculated and how to get started on your credit journey. How Long Does It Take to Build Credit? If you're just starting out, you'll need at least one credit account open and reporting to at least one of the major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) for at least six months to generate a FICO credit score. FICOÂ® ScoresÎ are used by 90% of top lenders. With the VantageScoreÂ® credit score, however, you can get a score as soon as the first time your new account gets reported to the credit reporting agencies. But having enough credit history to get a credit score is just the beginning. While your credit score is an important indicator of credit health, having a thin credit fileâa credit report with fewer than five credit accountsâcan still make it challenging to get approved for favorable financing terms. As you add more credit accounts over time and use them responsibly, you'll likely see an increase in your credit scores, and your credit profile will become more solid. Depending on how often you take on new credit, it can take several years to build an excellent credit history. How a Credit Score Is Calculated A credit score is a three-digit number that uses the information that appears on your credit report to provide a snapshot of your overall credit health. Lenders refer to this score to help them determine their level of risk in lending you money. There are many credit scoring models, but most lenders use the FICOÂ® Score or VantageScore credit score, both of which range from 300 to 850. Higher scores indicate you are less likely to default on a loanâin other words, that you are more "creditworthy." Each credit scoring model uses a proprietary algorithm that weighs data differently, but the same general rules apply. Here are the main factors they consider when calculating your score: Payment history: On-time payments are crucial in establishing a positive payment history. If you miss a payment by 30 days or more, even just once, it can have a significant negative impact on your score. - Amounts owed: The total amount you owe is considered, but the most influential factor is your credit utilization rate. This rate represents the percentage of the available credit on your credit cards and other lines of credit that you're using at a given time. A low credit utilization rate is better for your scores, while high utilization can hurt scores. - Length of credit history: In addition to how long your oldest account has been active, scoring models also consider the average age of your credit accounts and when they were last used. - Credit mix: Having a good mix of creditâincluding installment loans such as car loans and personal loans, and revolving credit such as credit cardsâshows that you're capable of managing different types of credit. - New credit: This factor focuses on how often you apply for credit. Each new hard inquiry a lender makes on your credit report when you apply for credit won't have a huge impact on your score, but if you apply for a lot of different types of loans and lines of credit in a short period of time, it can have a compounding effect. - Reasons
