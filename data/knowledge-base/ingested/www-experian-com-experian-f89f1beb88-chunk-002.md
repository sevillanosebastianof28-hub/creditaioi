of late or missed payments. Utilization rate, or usage rate, is a technical way of describing how close you are to "maxing out" your credit card accounts. You can measure utilization on an account-by-account basis by dividing each outstanding balance by the card's spending limit, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. Find your total utilization rate by adding up all the balances and dividing by the sum of all the spending limits: Balance | Spending limit | Utilization rate (%) | ---|---|---| MasterCard | $1,200 | $4,000 | 30% | ---|---|---|---| VISA | $1,000 | $6,000 | 17% | ---|---|---|---| American Express | $3,000 | $10,000 | 30% | ---|---|---|---| Total | $5,200 | $20,000 | 26% | ---|---|---|---| Most experts agree that utilization rates in excess of 30%âon individual accounts and all accounts in totalâwill push credit scores downward. The closer you get to âmaxing outâ any cardsâthat is, moving their utilization rates toward 100%âthe more you hurt your credit score. Utilization is second only to making timely payments in terms of influence on your credit score; it contributes nearly one-third (30%) of your credit score. It's old but it's good. All other factors being the same, the longer your credit history, the higher your credit score likely will be. That doesn't help much if your recent credit history is bogged down by late payments or high utilization, and there's little you can do about it if you're a new borrower. But if you manage your credit carefully and keep up with your payments, your credit score will tend to increase over time. Age of credit history is responsible for as much as 15% of your credit score. New credit activity typically has a short-term negative effect on your credit score. Any time you apply for new credit or take on additional debt, credit-scoring systems determine that you are greater risk of being able to pay your debts. Credit scores typically dip a bit when that happens, but rebound within a few months as long as you keep up with your bills. Because of this factor, it's a good idea to "rest" six months or so between applications for new creditâand to avoid opening new accounts in the months before you plan to apply for a major loan such as a mortgage or an auto loan. New-credit activity can contribute up to 10% of your overall credit score. A variety of credit accounts promotes credit-score improvements. The FICOÂ® credit scoring system tends to favor individuals with multiple credit accounts, including both revolving credit (accounts such as credit cards that enable you to borrow against a spending limit and make payments of varying amounts each month) and installment loans (e.g., car loans, mortgages and student loans, with set monthly payments and fixed payback periods). Credit mix accounts for about 10% of your credit score. 60% of individuals with a 700 FICOÂ® Score have credit portfolios that include auto loan. 36% have a mortgage. Public records such as bankruptcies do not appear in every credit report, so these entries cannot be compared to other score influences in percentage terms. If one or more is listed on your credit report, it can outweigh all other factors and severely lower your credit score. For example, a bankruptcy can stay on your credit report for 10 years, and may shut you out of access to many types of credit for much or all of that time. How to build up your credit score Your FICOÂ® Score is solid, and you have reasonably good odds of qualifying for a wide variety of loans. But if you can improve your credit score and eventually reach the Very Good (740-799) or Exceptional (800-850) credit-score ranges, you may become eligible for better interest rates that can save you thousands of dollars in interest over the
