1.88% | 2.24% | ---|---|---| Auto loans | 3.51% | 3.68% | ---|---|---| Personal loans (unsecured) | 3.89% | 3.86% | ---|---|---| Source: Experian data from September of each year Delinquency rates for auto loans and personal loans were also very similar to 2023 levels. The only major credit category on the rise is mortgages, where delinquency levels increased from 1.88% in 2023 to 2.24% in 2024. But this elevated rate is still below pre-pandemic levels, which were as high as 2.48% in 2019. Even if the delinquency rate rose to 2019's high, however, it still wouldn't be close to levels associated with economic slowdown or recession. Is This as Good as It Gets for Consumers? All of these plateaus consumers had collectively reached in 2024âincluding average credit scores and credit utilization ratiosâperhaps show that the borrowing health of consumers is generally good, but possibly at a point where further improvement is unlikely. We asked Jim Bander, a data scientist with Experian Decision Analytics, for some insight. While he stopped short of making a prediction, Bander still believes in what many economists have observed over the years: the resilience of the U.S. consumer. "If there's one thing I've learned from the data about the American consumer, it's that they are incredibly resilient," Bander says. "Credit scores may not improve in the next year or two, but I'm confident that future consumers will be even more creditworthy than today's consumers." What factors spark confidence exactly? "For one: My analysis shows that consumers in their 20s today show more responsibility than older generations did at the same age, in terms of credit delinquency and utilization," Bander says. "For another: Many millennials will be even more able to pay their bills and control their balances in the future than today. I've seen estimates that the beneficiaries of the upcoming so-called 'great wealth transfer' may inherit $90 trillion within the next decade or so." Bander also dismisses the idea of credit scores being inflated versus in prior years. "There is a common misconception that a credit score of 720 corresponds to a particular probability of default that should not change over time," he says. "The important thing to know is that a person with a credit score of 720 today is more creditworthy than a person with a credit score of 680 today; just as a person with a credit score of 720 is more creditworthy than a person with a credit score of 680 was in 2010. The credit score-to-risk ratio depends on a number of factors related to the economy, the specific credit product and even the lender's own loan servicing practices." Where Consumers Stand Heading Into 2025 Economic concerns continue to be front of mind for many consumers. Affordability looms large, not only for everyday items like gasoline and groceries but also big-ticket items like homes and vehicles. Despite wage increases that keep up with inflation, many consumers continue to feel stretched and generally weary of financial surprises. Although not all recent and sudden price increases affected every consumer demographic, nearly everyone was impacted. Generation Z, which typically has larger auto insurance premiums than older generations, has seen average car insurance premiums increase 20% over the past year, according to federal data. Meanwhile, rental costs (most independent Gen Zers are renters) increased by more than 30% since 2019 in many housing markets. - Millennials yearning for their first home are having doubts if they'll ever reach the American dream, as homeownership levels for millennials are lower than for the generations who preceded them when they were that age. Mortgage rates increasing to 7% despite fed rate cuts doesn't make that aspiration any easier. - Generation X, still carrying the largest debt burden by far, is nearing retirement age, and many would-be retirees' accounts are nowhere near ready for that moment. -
