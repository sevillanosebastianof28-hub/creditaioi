Our Work Our work brings legal domain expertise together with emerging technologies to enhance and explain the law for the public. We identify, extract, annotate, index, and present features latent in the raw data provided by government publishers. We also create original content meant to explain and clarify the law, like Wex, our Supreme Court Bulletin Previews, and the case summaries in our Gender Justice Collection. The output of all that expertise is the content found in the various collections available for free on this website. This page organizes that work into both the various projects we undertake and the collections of content we publish.
