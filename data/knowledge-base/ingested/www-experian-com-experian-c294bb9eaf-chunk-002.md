Security Freeze There are several common scenarios when you'll need to temporarily or permanently lift your security freeze: Applying for new credit: Whether you're applying for a credit card, personal loan, auto loan or mortgage, lenders will need access to your credit report to make their decision. - Getting preapproved for major purchases: Mortgage and auto loan preapprovals require lenders to review your credit history. Having your freeze lifted in advance can speed up the preapproval process. - Opening new accounts: Some banks and credit unions may check your credit when you open checking or savings accounts. - Signing up for services: You may need to unfreeze your credit when getting an internet plan, cellphone contract or utility services. These companies often check your credit to determine whether you need to pay a security deposit. - Employment background checks: Some employers conduct credit checks as part of their hiring process, particularly for positions that involve financial responsibilities. - Insurance applications: Many insurance companies use credit-based insurance scores when determining your rates and eligibility. - Stay Protected While Staying Flexible Managing a security freeze doesn't have to be complicated.
