in your credit scores is payment history. To build credit with your credit card, make at least your minimum payment on time every month. If you miss your bill's due date, the card issuer may charge you a fee and you could lose any introductory or promotional interest rates on your account. One of the best ways to ensure you never miss a payment is to set up autopay on your account. You can make the minimum payment using autopay, then pay the remaining balance, or as much as you can, separately. If you make a late payment, the credit card company can report your account as late to the credit bureaus once it's 30 days past due. A late payment is a negative mark that can hurt your credit scores and stay on your credit report for up to seven years. Maintain a Low Utilization Rate Your credit card's balance relative to its credit limit is also an important factor in your credit score. Credit scoring models use the balance and credit limit as they appear on your credit report to calculate your credit utilization ratio. Low utilization (which can be achieved with a low balance) is better for your credit. Limiting your card use, especially when you have a low credit limit, could help you maintain a low utilization rate. If you use your card often or for a large purchase, you can lower your reported balance by paying down your card's balance before the end of your statement periodâabout 21 to 25 days before your bill's due date. There's no perfect utilization rate, but aim to keep it below 10% for the best credit scores. How to Build Credit Without a Credit Card While opening and using credit cards can be a good way to build credit, they're not the only option. Loans and other types of accounts can also help if they're reported to the credit bureaus. When you're starting out, you could look into credit-builder loans, which are designed specifically for this purpose. Other common loans, such as student, auto and mortgage loans can also help you build credit. As with credit cards, making payments on time with loans is the most important factor in building credit. Your remaining balance can also impact your scores, but it's not as important as utilization rates on credit cards. Other types of accounts, such as utility and phone plans, often don't get reported to the bureaus or impact your credit. However, Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸ is a free service that allows you to add your phone and utility accounts to your Experian credit report so they can help you build credit. There are also rent reporting services that you may be able to use to add your rent payments to your credit reports. As mentioned, there are several other ways to build credit, with no credit history.
