You generally can't deposit money at any ATM. For security and efficiency reasons, many banks and financial institutions limit cash deposits to their in-network ATMs. Read on to explore the reasons behind this restriction and get guidance on depositing cash at an ATM, ensuring a hassle-free and secure transaction. Why You Can't Deposit Cash at Any ATM Banks often restrict cash deposits to in-network ATMs for several reasons. First and foremost, it helps ensure the security of your funds. By limiting deposits to only ATMs owned and operated by your bank, they can closely monitor and control the entire deposit process. In-network ATMs have advanced security measures like surveillance cameras, encryption technology and secure vaults, which help safeguard against theft and fraud.
