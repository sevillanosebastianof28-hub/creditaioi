the seller refuses to allow an inspection, consider it a major red flag. 5. Negotiate the Price Private sellers often have more flexibility on price than dealers. Use your research and inspection findings to justify your offer. Be respectful but firm. If you can't reach an agreement, it's OK to walk away. There are plenty of other cars on the market. 6. Make an Offer Using a Secure Payment Method Once you've agreed on a price, use a secure payment method. For large transactions, a cashier's check from your bank is generally the safest option. Avoid paying with cash if possible, and never agree to wire money to a sellerâthis is a common scam. If the seller is willing, consider completing the transaction at your bank for an extra layer of security. 7. Handle the Paperwork Unlike a dealership, a private seller won't handle the paperwork for you. Contact your local department of motor vehicles (DMV) to find out what documents you'll need. Requirements typically include: A signed title transferred to your name - A bill of sale - An odometer disclosure statement - Driver's license - Proof of insurance - Visit your DMV promptly to register the vehicle and pay any applicable sales tax.
