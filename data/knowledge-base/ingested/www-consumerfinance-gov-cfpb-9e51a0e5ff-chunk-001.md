FOIA requests The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a law that enables members of the public to request records from the government. The Privacy Act provides individuals a way to request access to records about them. Expected timeframe The goal is to respond within the time frame outlined in the Freedom of Information Act, which is twenty working days or approximately one month from the receipt of the request, but our ability to meet this goal may vary with the complexity of the request. When the CFPB needs an extension of time to respond to your request it will notify you in writing and offer you the opportunity to modify or limit the scope of your request. Alternatively, you may agree to a different timetable for the processing of your request. Our work Submit a request Follow the instructions and fill out a form to create a new request under either FOIA or the Privacy Act. Fee schedule There is no initial fee to make a request, but fees may apply based on the cost of fulfilling your request. FOIA FAQs Learn more about the process, your rights, and what to expect.
