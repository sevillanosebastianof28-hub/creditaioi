We work to advance government policies that protect consumers and promote competition. As part of its policy, advocacy, and research work, the agency: files advocacy letters - files amicus briefs to aid in court deliberations - gives Congressional testimony - solicits and reviews public comments regarding rules, cases, and policies - issues advisory opinions - conducts workshops - publishes reports that examine cutting-edge antitrust and consumer protection issues - conducts studies pursuant to Section 6 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 USC § 46 - The FTC also works with competition and consumer protection agencies around the world to promote cooperation and sound policy approaches. The FTC has built strong relationships with its counterparts abroad, and helps countries around the world to develop and enhance their competition and consumer protection programs.
