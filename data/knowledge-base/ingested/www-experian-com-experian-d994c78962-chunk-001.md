7 Ways to Build Credit if You Have No Credit History Quick Answer Building credit from scratch? These tips can help get you on your way: To view important disclosures about the Experian Smart Moneyâ¢ Digital Checking Account & Debit Card, visit experian.com/legal. Finding a lender to approve you for a loan can be an uphill battle if you're new to credit, or "credit invisible." Credit invisible consumers don't have enough payment history reported to the credit bureaus to produce a credit score. It's no secret that credit is key when it comes time to finance big purchases, such as a car or a home. But even if you don't see yourself borrowing in the immediate future, having no credit history can be a barrier to accomplishing everyday tasks. Credit can come into play when you're renting an apartment, opening utility accounts, buying insurance and even looking for a job. Fortunately, it's possible to build good credit from scratchâand getting started today could put you in a better position to meet your financial goals of tomorrow. Here are seven ways to start building credit now. 1. Become an Authorized User If you don't have a history of managing credit accounts, it can be difficult to get approved for loans or credit cards. Becoming an authorized user on a family member's or friend's credit card is one way to build credit that doesn't involve applying for your own credit card. As an authorized user, you'll be added to the primary cardholder's account and get your own card you can use to make purchases. The credit card account, and its payment history, will appear on your credit report, helping you establish a credit history and score. Before asking a family member or friend to add you as an authorized user, it's important to make sure that the lender reports authorized user accounts to the credit bureaus. If payments aren't reported, this strategy may not do you much good. 2. Try a Credit-Building Debit Card If you're thinking about opening a new checking account, the Experian Smart Moneyâ¢ Digital Checking Account & Debit Card can help you build credit without debt by automatically linking to Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸, which gives you credit for eligible bill payments after three months of payments. Payment history is the most important factor in calculating your FICOÂ® ScoreÎ, so Experian Boost could help you make strides in your credit. Beyond connecting you with credit-building features, the Experian Smart Money Digital Checking Account has other benefits. You'll also pay no monthly feesÂ¶ for Experian Smart Money, have access to more than 55,000 fee-free ATMs worldwide** and could receive your paychecks up to two days early when you enroll in direct depositâ . You can get an Experian Smart Money Account through a free or paid Experian membership, which also gives you access to your FICOÂ® Score, Experian credit report and more. See terms at experian.com/legal. 3. Apply for a Secured Credit Card Applying for your own secured credit card can be an excellent way to build credit. A secured card is typically easier to qualify for than a traditional unsecured card because it requires a deposit upfront that "secures" your credit line. The deposit you'll need to provide varies depending on the credit card. Credit limits can also differ, but they are often equal to the amount of your security deposit. Some secured cards may charge an annual fee and other additional fees. If you're considering a secured card, shop around to see which credit card best fits your needs. Experian can help you find secured cards that may be right for you. Once you establish a positive payment history on the secured card, you may get your deposit back and the opportunity to upgrade to an unsecured card. 4.
