Taylor Kovar, a member of Investopedia’s Financial Advisor Council What Is a Mortgage and How Does It Work? A mortgage is a legal contract between a borrower and a lender, such as a bank or credit union, that's typically used for the purchase or refinancing of a home or other form of real estate. The lender makes a certain sum of money available, which the borrower agrees to pay back, along with interest, in regular monthly payments over a specified term, such as 30 years. In the meantime, the property serves as collateral for the loan, and the lender has a legal right to seize and sell it of the borrower fails to make the required payments. In most instances, lenders will also require a borrower to make an upfront down payment, such as 10% or 20% of the home's purchase price, and the lender will provide the rest of the money. The larger the down payment the borrower can afford to make, the less they will need to borrow. Mortgage contracts come to an end when the loan is fully paid off. If the borrower sells their home before the end of the loan term, the lender will receive the remaining balance it is owed at the real estate closing. Without mortgages most people, except for the very wealthy, wouldn't be able to afford their own homes. Types of Mortgages Many types of mortgages are available to homebuyers today. Two major categories are fixed-rate mortgages, the kind covered here, and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Adjustable mortgages often start with a fixed rate for a certain number of years, after which the rate will vary based on prevailing rates in the financial markets. Among fixed-rate mortgages, the two major types are conforming loans and non-conforming loans. Many lenders offer both types. Conforming loans "conform" to the rules as well as the terms and conditions set by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, two government-sponsored entities that purchase loans from lenders and package them into securities for sale to investors. This frees up the lenders' capital, allowing them to make more loans. It also results in loans being available to more would-be homebuyers, which is the reason that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were created. Conforming loans tend to have the most competitive interest rates. They also have dollar limits—$806,500 in most parts of the U.S. as of 2025. Borrowers who need more money can apply for non-conforming loans, often called jumbo loans, which typically carry higher interest rates. While the U.S. government doesn't make loans itself, it does guarantee certain loans issued by private lenders. Those include Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans for low- and moderate-income borrowers and VA loans for veterans and active service members. Mortgage Options for First-Time Homebuyers If you're a first-time homebuyer without a lot of cash available for a down payment, or if you have a lowish credit score, an FHA or VA loan might be your best option if you qualify. FHA loans require down payments as low as 3.5%, while VA loans are available with 0% down. Both also have comparatively low interest rates. One small downside of FHA loans is that they require borrowers to pay mortgage insurance premiums (MIPs) both upfront and on an ongoing basis, adding to their costs. VA loans don't have that requirement. If you have a relatively good credit score and can afford a down payment of, say, 10% or more, you'll find many options in the broader market for conforming mortgages. If you can afford to put down 20% or more you won't have to pay for private mortgage insurance (PMI). Note that many banks and credit unions offer all of these different kinds of mortgages, so a loan officer there should be able to acquaint you with your various options and point you in the right direction.
