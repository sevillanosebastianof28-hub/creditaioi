Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Association (NCUA). These types of CDs pay higher interest rates to investors due to the higher risk they present. Uninsured CDs are offered by investment firms and foreign banks that are not eligible for insurance coverage. Brokered CDs are offered to investors through investment firms and are technically not insured by the FDIC. However, the savings held by the investment firm with a commercial bank, from which the brokered CDs are created, are insured, which offers investors a degree of protection. Brokered CDs offer investors more flexibility and higher yields vs. traditional certificates of deposit but also present higher risk. A liquid certificate of deposit is a type of CD that allows the investor to make withdrawals before the CD reaches maturity without incurring an early withdrawal penalty. Traditional certificates of deposit do impose early withdrawal penalties so liquid CDs offer much more flexibility, although they pay less interest in exchange for that flexibility.
