rebuild a damaged score and would have difficulty getting approved for other forms of credit. That said, as is the case with any credit product, it's important to carefully weigh the benefits against risks. First, as is the case with any loan, if you're unable to afford your monthly payments, you could end up damaging your credit. Be sure to budget carefully to ensure you're able to pay on time each month before you apply for a loan. Also, be sure you understand how much the credit-builder loan will cost you in interest and other fees. Say, for example, you apply for a credit-builder loan of $1,000 with a 12-month term and 5% annual percentage rate (APR) with a credit union. You'll pay $86 per month, including $27 in interest. At the end of 12 months, your credit union will return the $1,000 to you. You may also receive a portion of the interest you paid back, but this depends on the specific lender's policies. Other Ways to Build Credit Getting a credit-builder loan isn't the only way to give your credit profile a boost. Here are some other ways you may be able to build credit: Apply for a Secured Credit Card Unlike a traditional unsecured credit card, a secured credit card requires you to make a deposit, generally $200 to $2,000, which usually becomes your credit limit. You can use the secured card like a traditional card, charging small amounts and paying your full balance each month. Over time, if you use the card responsibly, the bank may be willing to convert it to a regular unsecured credit card. Make sure the issuer reports your account activity to the credit bureaus so the card will, in fact, help you build credit. Become an Authorized User Authorized users on credit card accounts are not responsible for making payments, but they can still use the account if the primary cardholder agrees. Payment history on the card will appear on their credit reports. Not all creditors report authorized user accounts to the credit bureaus, though, so ask before being added. Apply for a Personal Loan If you're able to qualify for one, you might also consider using a traditional personal loan to build credit. There are two types of personal loans to consider: Secured personal loans are backed by collateral, which the lender could take possession of if you don't repay the loan as agreed. While a secured personal loan can help you build credit, the prospect of losing the collateral you put upâsuch as your carâcould make this a riskier option than, say, a secured credit card that requires a small cash deposit. - Unsecured personal loans aren't backed by collateral, so they may have higher interest rates and be harder to get than secured personal loans. Lenders will look at your income, credit scores and other financial obligations that affect whether you can repay the loan. But like secured personal loans and other installment loans, making on-time payments can bolster your credit score. - Try Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸ Experian Boost is a free feature that allows you to integrate eligible rent, utility, cellphone and some streaming service payments into your Experian FICOÂ® Score.
