credit card debt, your utilization rate won't be a factor since credit scoring models only consider utilization of revolving credit (such as credit cards). In fact, reducing your utilization rate on your credit cards to 0% can potentially help your credit score. Pros and Cons of Debt Consolidation Pros Potential savings: Whether you pick a balance transfer credit card or a personal loan with a lower interest rate than the one you're currently paying, you could potentially save hundredsâeven thousandsâof dollars on interest charges. It could also result in a lower monthly payment, freeing up some cash flow in your budget. - Repayment flexibility: With a balance transfer card, you could get a 0% intro APR promotion for anywhere between 12 and 21 months. But if you have a lot of debt and need more flexibility with your monthly payment, you could opt for a debt consolidation loan and get more options, making it easier to find a term that works for you. - Easier to manage: If you have multiple monthly debt payments, consolidating your debts combines them into one payment, making it easier to manage your repayment plan. - Cons May not qualify: If you don't have good or excellent credit, you may have a hard time getting approved for a balance transfer card or a low-interest debt consolidation loan. Even if your score is in good shape, you may not get the terms you're looking for if you have a significant amount of debt. - May be upfront fees: You'll be hard-pressed to find a balance transfer credit card that doesn't charge a balance transfer fee on a 0% APR promotion. While you can get a personal loan with no origination fee, your options may be limited if your credit isn't near perfect. While these fees aren't necessarily a deal-breaker, don't forget to include them when calculating your potential savings. - Could lead to more debt: While consolidating your debt can put you in a better position to pay down your debt, it doesn't change the circumstances that put you in debt in the first place. Unless you have a clear plan for avoiding more debt, freeing up available credit on a credit card with another card or a personal loan could put you in danger of racking up another balance. - Should You Consolidate Your Debt? As you weigh the advantages and disadvantages of debt consolidation, think carefully about how they apply to your situation and goals. Consider consolidating your debt in these scenarios: You have high-interest credit card debt. Debt consolidation works best for credit card debt because it offers a lot of potential savings. - You have great credit. Having a credit score in the 700s or higher will give you the best chance of securing favorable debt consolidation terms. - You have a payoff plan. If you're thinking about a balance transfer card, consider it only if you can afford to pay off your debt within the promotional period and you have enough discipline to stick to your repayment plan. - You're taking steps to tackle overspending. If you've gotten on a budget and worked to spend within your means, you're less likely to repeat your mistakes after consolidation. - Consider alternatives to debt consolidation if: You want to pay off lower-interest debt. If you have another type of debt you want to pay off, such as a mortgage, auto loan or student loan, look into refinancing that debt for better terms instead of including it in your consolidation. - You have a bad credit score. You'll have a difficult time getting approved for a lower interest rate than what you're currently paying unless your credit is in good shape. - You're looking for a temporary fix. Debt consolidation can provide some relief on interest charges and monthly payments. However, if you don't
