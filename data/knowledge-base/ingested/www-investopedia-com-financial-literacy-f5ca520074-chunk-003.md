ultimately failed. That started to change in 1693, when astronomer and mathematician Edmund Halley, best known today as the namesake of Halley's Comet, studied birth and death records in the city of Breslau for the purposes of calculating the price of life annuities. This gave rise to the use of mortality tables in the insurance industry. The Slow Integration of Insurance into America Insurance companies thrived in Europe, especially after the Industrial Revolution. Across the Atlantic, in America, the story was very different. Colonists' lives were fraught with dangers that no insurance company would touch. For example, starvation and related diseases killed almost three out of every four colonists in the Jamestown settlement between 1609 and 1610, a bleak period that came to be known as "The Starving Time." Ultimately, it took more than 100 years for insurance to establish itself in America. When it finally did, starting around the 1750s, it brought the maturity in both practice and policies that developed during the same period of time in Europe. When Did Insurance First Start? Insurance has had a long history and its starting point can trace back to different times depending on the type of insurance. It has its origins in the Babylonian empire, Medieval guilds, the Great Fire of London, and maritime insurance. What Is the Oldest Form of Insurance? Some of the oldest forms of insurance are considered to be the bottomry contracts of merchants in Babylon around 3,000 to 4,000 BCE. These contracts stipulated that the loans that merchants took out for shipments would not need to be paid if the shipment was lost at sea. What Is the Oldest Insurance Company in the World? The oldest insurance company in the world is considered to be Hamburger Feuerkasse, which was founded in 1676. Its first policies provided fire insurance within the the city walls of Hamburg and reimbursed owners the market value of their buildings up to 15,000 marks, with a 25% deductible. The Bottom Line The history of insurance stretches back to the Code of Hammurabi, through the mutual support systems of medieval guilds, and the rise of fire insurance after the Great Fire of London. Over centuries, insurance has evolved into a vital tool for managing risk by spreading potential losses among many. Though it can be costly, it has consistently protected individuals and businesses from financial hardship and remains essential to economic stability.
