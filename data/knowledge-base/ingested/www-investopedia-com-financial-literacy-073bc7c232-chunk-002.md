the continuation of your insurance coverage. Insurance Consequences of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy If your employer files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it may drop its employee insurance benefits, cut employees' hours, or lay people off. If you keep your job, you may be able to keep your group insurance coverage if your company maintains its group plans. Navigating Health Insurance and COBRA During Bankruptcy Should your employer discontinue all of its health plans in Chapter 11, you will lose your coverage and be unable to continue it through COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) because your plan no longer exists. On the other hand, should it maintain a group health plan, COBRA may allow you to continue coverage. If your company employs at least 20 people and you're laid off or your job status changes, causing a loss of insurance coverage, COBRA can help you and your dependents to maintain your current policy because it provides you with an opportunity to buy extended health coverage under your employer’s plan. Under COBRA, group health insurance coverage can be maintained for up to 18 months. However, you will need to pay both your portion of the premium payment, which you may have been paying through paycheck withholdings, and your employer's portion of the monthly premium amount, plus a 2% fee. After 18 months in most states, COBRA ends (although depending on the qualifying event, COBRA may extend to 36 months for a spouse or dependent child). At this point, you will need to obtain new health insurance coverage. You might do this through a new employer, by purchasing a new individual plan, or by joining your spouse's plan. Your employer is required to give you 60 days notification before your coverage ends. During that period, be sure to obtain a certificate of creditable coverage, which you will need to apply for a new policy. If you lose your group plan benefits because they're discontinued, confirm whether your employer offers a conversion option that would allow you to get individual health coverage. Managing Life and Disability Insurance Amid Bankruptcy If you have life and/or disability insurance coverage through work, you may lose that coverage, either because your job has changed or been eliminated, or the company cancels its group plans. If that happens, talk with your insurance administrator to find out if you can transfer from your group policy to an individual policy. Important COBRA Continuation Coverage can help employees (and their loved ones) to maintain their group health coverage temporarily despite the loss of a job, a drop in work hours, or experiencing a transition period between jobs. Consequences of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on Employee Insurance In the event that your employer files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you will lose all forms of employer-based group insurance coverage because those plans will cease to exist. As soon as you learn that your company is filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, check on any outstanding insurance claims that you have submitted for payment and reimbursement. If those claims are not paid out before the company closes, you may need to file a "proof of claims" with the bankruptcy court. If you elected to have money withheld from your paychecks and deposited into a flexible spending account (FSA) for healthcare expenses, you should check with your company's benefits administrator to ensure that you receive compensation for the sums withheld. Transitioning from Group to Individual Insurance Plans Some insurance companies will allow you to convert from a canceled group plan to an individual plan. Typically, you will not have to provide any additional information when applying for an individual policy. However, you will need to complete some paperwork and cover all premium payments. The rules for converting to a personal policy vary by state, so you will need to check with your state insurance association. There is
