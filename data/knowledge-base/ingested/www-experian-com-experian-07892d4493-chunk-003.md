minimizes credit score impact while also helping you find the best deal. Learn more: Credit Score Basics: Everything You Need to Know How to Improve Your Credit Score Paying off revolving account balances is one way to help improve your credit score relatively quickly, but there are other things you can do to help increase your score over time. Make payments on time. A consistent history of timely payments is key to improving your credit score. If you struggle to remember due dates or have lots of credit cards and loans, setting up autopayment can help. - Minimize credit utilization. Lower is better; people with the highest credit scores tend to have credit utilization rates under 10%. If your credit cards have low limits, making payments throughout the month or paying the balance right before your billing cycle ends can help keep utilization rates low. - Limit applications for new credit. Too many hard inquiries can negatively impact your credit score, so don't apply for credit unless you really need it. Many lenders allow you to prequalify for loans or credit cards, which involves a soft credit check that doesn't affect your credit score. - Keep old credit card accounts open. Closing a credit card reduces your available credit and could hurt your credit mix if it's your only revolving credit account. If there's a high annual fee, ask about downgrading to a no-annual-fee card so you can keep the account open for free. - Tip: To make sure your timely payments are reflected accurately, check your credit report from all three credit bureaus, which you can do for free weekly at AnnualCreditReport.com.
