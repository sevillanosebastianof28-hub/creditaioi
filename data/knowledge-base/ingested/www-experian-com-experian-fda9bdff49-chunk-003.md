dispute in your credit report, explaining that you dispute the collection account and why. 3. Contact the Original Creditor In some cases, you may need to contact the creditor who sold your debt to the collection agency in the first place. If they determine the debt went to collections by mistake, they can contact the collection agency and try to resolve the issue. How to Improve Your Credit When You Have Collections Accurate collection accounts can't be removed from your credit reports until they legitimately expire in seven years. However, you don't have to wait that long to start improving your credit. In addition to paying unpaid collection accounts, here are some steps to take right away. Dispute any inaccuracies on your credit reports. You can get your credit reports from all three credit bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com for free. Check for other inaccuracies and, if you find them, you have the right to dispute them with the credit bureau. - Pay your bills on time. Because payment history is the most important factor in your credit scores, late or missed payments can have a major negative impact. Consider setting up automatic bill payments so you won't miss upcoming due dates. - Reduce your credit card balances. Credit utilization ratio, or your amount of outstanding credit card debt compared with your total credit limit, is a big element in your credit score. Aim to keep credit utilization below 30%; ideally, keep it under 10%. - Avoid applying for new credit. Each application for credit creates a hard inquiry that can temporarily lower your credit score by a few points. New credit cards may also tempt you to spend beyond your budget, which could hurt scores. - Don't close unused credit cards. Even if you no longer use a credit card, keeping the account open can benefit your credit score. Closing unused credit cards reduces your available credit, which may increase your credit utilization ratio. This can lower your credit score. - The Bottom Line Collection accounts on your credit report can have a lasting impact, but there are steps you can take to minimize their effects.
