Leasing allows you to drive the latest models with updated technology and safety features without the hassle of selling or trading in your vehicle. - You prefer lower monthly payments. Since you're only paying for the vehicle's depreciation during the lease term, monthly lease payments are typically lower than loan payments for the same vehicle. - You want minimal maintenance costs. New leased vehicles are usually covered by the manufacturer's warranty throughout the lease term, keeping repair costs low or nonexistent. - You drive 12,000 to 15,000 miles or less annually. Most leases include mileage limits in this range. If your commute is short or you don't take frequent road trips, you can stay within these restrictions without extra fees. - You have good credit. Leasing companies typically require good to excellent credit scores to qualify for the best lease terms and rates. - Building equity isn't a priority. If you're not concerned about owning your vehicle outright or using it as a trade-in later, leasing provides flexibility without the commitment of ownership. - When It May Be Better to Buy a Car You want to keep your vehicle long term. Buying makes financial sense if you plan to drive your car for many years, especially after paying off the loan, when you'll have no monthly payments. - You're considering a used vehicle. Leasing is typically only available for new cars, so buying is your only option if you want a pre-owned vehicle at a lower price point. - You want to build equity. Each loan payment increases your ownership stake in the vehicle, giving you trade-in value or cash when you're ready for your next car. - You drive more than 15,000 miles per year. Buying eliminates mileage restrictions, so you can drive as much as you need without worrying about excess mileage fees. - You want the freedom to customize. Ownership allows you to modify your vehicle however you like, from performance upgrades to cosmetic changes. - You want lower costs over time. While monthly payments are higher initially, buying can save you money in the long run since you'll eventually own the vehicle outright and eliminate monthly payments. - Frequently Asked Questions Check Your Credit Before You Buy or Lease Regardless of how you decide to acquire your next car, know what your credit looks like before you start the process.
