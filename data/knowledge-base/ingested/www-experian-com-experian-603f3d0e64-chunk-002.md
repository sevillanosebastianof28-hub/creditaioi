you to up your credit scoreâin addition to benefits like lower interest rates on loans and a potentially easier time qualifying for new credit. To improve your credit score, try these tactics: Put bills on autopay. Since payment history is the biggest contributor to your credit score, try not to miss even a single credit card, loan or utility bill payment. Set up automatic payments from your checking account so you never fall behind, but make sure your account has enough funds to avoid overdrawing it. - Cut down on debt. Your credit utilization, or the amount of available credit you're using compared with your credit limit, is the second most important element of your credit score. If you've been carrying a balance on a current credit card, pay it off before you apply for a new one. Avoid applying for new lines of credit in the months before getting a new credit card, too, since doing so could land hard inquiries on your credit report. These could lead to a brief dip in your score, since financial institutions may view customers who frequently seek credit as a lending risk. - Dispute errors on your credit report. Check your credit report to make sure your personal information is correct, that all the accounts listed are those you opened, and that all payments were accurately reported. Certain errors can bring down your score. If you see an on-time payment incorrectly listed as late, for instance, file a dispute with the appropriate credit bureau to have it corrected. - Use Rewards Cards the Right Way Qualifying for a rewards card is just the start. Choosing one that you'll use regularlyâand has perks that work for your spendingâis the next step. But take care not to charge more than you can pay off each month. While that's an important financial strategy no matter what, it's especially crucial when your goal is to earn rewards; they'll lose value if you carry a balance and accrue interest on your purchases. Spend enough to get the cash back or points you'll use, then pay off your balance monthly so you can get the most out of your new card. Another thing: Never spend more than you would otherwise with the sole intention of reaping rewards for the money you spend. Make sure your rewards work for you, not the other way around.
