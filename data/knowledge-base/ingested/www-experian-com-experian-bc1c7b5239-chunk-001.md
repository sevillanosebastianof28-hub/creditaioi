Pros and Cons of Debt Consolidation Quick Answer Debt consolidation might lower your monthly payments, make managing your monthly payments easier, decrease your interest rates and save you money overall. But there are also potential drawbacks, such as upfront fees and the risk of winding up deeper in debt. Consolidating multiple debts into one can be a strategic move that helps you save time and money. However, there are drawbacks to consider along with those potential advantages. As a result, debt consolidation isn't a good option for everyone. You can consolidate debt by taking out a new loan and using the funds to pay off your existing debt. You can also apply for a balance transfer credit card and transfer balances onto the new card to consolidate your debts. Or, you could use an existing credit line or credit card. Each option can reduce the interest you pay and make payments more manageable. Before you proceed with consolidating your debt, however, consider these pros and cons to help you decide whether it makes sense. Pros | Cons | ---|---| You'll have fewer bills to manage | There may be upfront fees | You could save money if you receive a lower interest rate | You may not qualify for a favorable offer | You can bring past-due accounts current | Freeing up available credit could lead to more debt | You can pay off debt faster | Your credit could suffer if you miss payments | You can build credit with on-time payments | Benefits of Debt Consolidation In the right situation, debt consolidation comes with a host of advantages for your financial health. Here's how consolidating debt can help you. You'll Have Fewer Bills to Manage Consolidation can make managing your household budget easier by reducing the number of accounts you'll need to track and pay each month.

You Could Save Money if You Qualify for a Lower Interest Rate If your credit is in good shape, you could qualify for a consolidation loan with a lower interest rate, reducing your total interest costs and also potentially lowering your monthly payment. You could also look into balance transfer credit cards, which offer a low or even 0% introductory annual percentage rate (APR) for a period usually ranging from 12 to 21 months. If you can manage to pay off the debt before the promotional period ends, you can eliminate interest charges entirely.

For starters, the longer an account goes unpaid, the more damage it does to your credit score, so paying off your past-due debts can stop the bleeding, so to speak. Second, some newer credit scoring models don't include collection accounts that have been paid in full, so consolidating a debt in collections could potentially increase your score. Tip: It may be possible to qualify for a debt consolidation loan if you have past-due payments. That said, you may qualify for better terms if you bring your accounts current and give your credit some time to improve before you shop around for a new loan. You Can Pay Off Debt Faster Minimizing the interest you pay on your debt not only saves you money but also shortens your timeline for becoming debt-free (assuming you don't add debt elsewhere).
