your credit card balances faster can have an impact. All else being equal, paying down your balances lowers your credit utilization ratio, which in turn can help your score. When considering a new side hustle, be sure to look for something that aligns with your current skills and interests. Also, be sure to factor in your scheduleâideally, look for a flexible gig that you can easily work around your current routine, such as freelancing or driving for a ridesharing app. Learn more: Side Hustles That Can Help You Pay Off Debt 22. Get a Loan With the Help of a Cosigner Making on-time payments toward an installment loan, similar to making timely payments on a credit card, helps build credit history. Besides using a credit-builder loan, getting a traditional one such as a car loan can add positive information to your credit report and improve your credit mix. If you can't qualify for a loan on your own, a cosigner can helpâbut make sure the cosigner knows what they are getting into. If you can't afford to repay the loan, it becomes their responsibility. Also, as always, only seek out a loan if you really need it, not simply to improve credit. Potentially boosting your score should be an added bonus or motivation, not the central reason. 23. Ask for Credit Line Increases Increasing the credit limit on your credit cardâwhile maintaining the same amount of spendingâlowers your credit utilization rate, which can improve your credit score. Some credit card issuers may automatically increase your line after you've used the card actively and responsibly for a certain period of time. But in other cases, it may be worth it to request a credit limit increase. Your issuer may pull your credit when deciding whether to grant you an increase, which could temporarily lower your score by a few points, but the long-term benefit of a higher limit could be worth it. Just be sure you don't run up the balance on your card, or your score will likely suffer. 24. Use Your Tax Refund to Help Your Score Tax season is just around the corner, so this is a New Year's resolution you can set now and put into action once you get your refund. Consider earmarking your tax refund to help you pay off debt and improve your score. For example, you could put your full refund toward a high-interest balance you're carrying. Or, you could put that money toward the deposit on a secured credit card to help you get started establishing a credit history. Learn more: Should I Use My Tax Refund to Pay Off Debt? 25. Freeze Your Credit Consider taking extra precautions to protect your credit. You have the right to freeze your credit with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. While implementing a security freeze won't raise your credit score, it will help limit fraudulent activity. A credit freeze limits access to your credit report and prevents someone else from opening new credit accounts in your name. This can help you avoid the credit score damage that often comes with fraud. 26. Have Patience Improving credit isn't an immediate process. An excellent credit score is most often the result of years of conscientious financial behavior. While some strategies will let you see small improvements quickly, joining the ranks of those with the highest credit scores will take time. If 2025 brought with it financial stress or hits to your credit, just commit to doing your best in 2026âand try to avoid moves that could jeopardize your credit.
