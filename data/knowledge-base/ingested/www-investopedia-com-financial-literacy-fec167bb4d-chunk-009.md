of the lowest mortgage rates among big banks right now but many banks and credit unions have competitive rates in local markets around the country so borrowers should do their homework before committing to a mortgage. We rank Bank of America as the best big bank mortgage lender because they offer multiple loan options for low- and middle-income borrowers, have a massive branch network across all 50 states, and offer loans with down payments as low as 0%–3%. When comparing rates on bank and mortgage lender websites it's important to note that many quote rates that involve the purchase of discount points. The rates that Investopedia tracks do not involve discount points. What Income Do You Need for an $800,000 Mortgage? The income needed for $800,000 is approximately $20,000 a month or $240,000 a year, assuming a 7% mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed-rate term. Lender requirements generally limit housing to no greater than 30% of gross household income. Will We Ever See a 3% Mortgage Rate Again? It's unlikely that 3% mortgage rates will be seen again in the foreseeable future because the conditions that produced those rates several years ago were driven by extremely rare economic conditions and resulting monetary policy. While rates are currently more than double those record lows, they could come down over the course of 2025 if the Federal Reserve cuts rates and other conditions are favorable, such as ongoing employment rates and the 10-year bond yield. Why Haven't Mortgage Rates Fallen Yet? Mortgage rates have held steady in an elevated range this year due to many factors, including Federal Reserve decisions to maintain the current discount rate, relatively low unemployment levels, and other economic headwinds like rising consumer prices and tariff policies. Up to five fed discount rate cuts were expected in 2025, but those expectations have been revised downward to a likely maximum of two 25 basis point cuts in the second half of the year. If those cuts materialize, then mortgage rates could begin to fall. Why You Should Trust Us Investopedia collects the best rates on actual closed mortgages from more than 200 companies every business day to identify the most competitive rates and terms in the nation as well as in the states in which our readers reside. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best mortgage rates since 2021. How We Track the Best Mortgage Rates To assess mortgage rates, we first needed to create a credit profile. This profile included a credit score ranging from 700 to 760 with a property loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 80%. With this profile, we averaged the lowest rates offered by more than 200 of the nation’s top lenders. These rates represent what real consumers will see when shopping for a mortgage. The same credit profile was used for the best state rates map. We then found the lowest rate currently offered by a surveyed lender in that state. Remember that mortgage rates may change daily, and this average rate data is intended for informational purposes only. A person’s personal credit and income profile will be the deciding factors in what loan rates and terms they can get. Loan rates do not include amounts for taxes or insurance premiums, and individual lender terms will apply. Your Guide to Mortgage Rates What Is a Mortgage?
