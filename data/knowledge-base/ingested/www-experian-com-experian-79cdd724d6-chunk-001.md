What Affects Your Credit Scores? Quick Answer Credit scoring systems analyze credit reports to evaluate how you manage credit. They focus on factors such as your payment history, your total debt, usage of available credit, length of credit history, credit mix and new credit. Credit scoring systems such as the FICOÂ® ScoreÎ and VantageScoreÂ® analyze credit report information to predict whether you'll pay your debts as agreed. Their software essentially uses advanced algorithms to comb your credit history for signs of good (and bad) credit management habits. The calculations that produce credit scores are closely kept trade secrets, but the underlying factors they consider (as well as how they're weighted) are public knowledge. The following factors and percentage weightings apply to the FICOÂ® Score, which is used by 90% of top lenders. VantageScore credit scoring factors differ somewhat, but adopting the habits described below will promote improvement on any credit score derived from credit report data. Here are the key factors that influence your credit scores, plus steps you can take to improve each factor. Factors That Determine Credit Scores 1. Payment History: 35% Payment history has the single biggest impact on your credit, which means paying your bills on time every month is key to building and maintaining good credit. Just one payment made 30 days late or more can do significant harm to your scores, and the negative impact can become more severe the further behind you fall on payments. An account sent to collections, a foreclosure or a bankruptcy can have even deeper, longer-lasting consequences. Payment history makes up 35% of your FICOÂ® Score. Key moves to make: Make all your debt payments on time every month. To ensure you don't forget, set up autopay or enable text alerts for payment due dates. If you anticipate struggling to afford your minimum payments, contact your creditors right away to negotiate a hardship plan. If you're already behind on payments, learn about how to bring your accounts current to mitigate the damage. Reach out to a nonprofit credit counselor if you're feeling overwhelmed by payments and need help. Learn more: How to Improve Your Payment History Instantly raise your credit scoresÃ¸ 2. Amounts Owed: 30% The total amount you've borrowed affects your credit score, as does the portion of your available credit in use. Your credit utilization ratio or rate, the percentage of your borrowing limit you're using on your credit cards and other revolving credit accounts, is a significant factor in this category. What credit utilization should you aim for? Those with the highest credit scores tend to have utilization ratios below 10%, but the lower, the better. Broadly speaking, keep your credit utilization ratio below 30% to avoid a more substantial negative impact on your credit scores. Amounts owed are responsible for 30% of your FICOÂ® Score. Key moves to make: Paying down installment loans, such as auto loans and personal loans, has a positive impact. If you're carrying high credit card balances, start paying them off to improve your credit utilization ratio. Calculate your current credit utilization ratio using the steps below. Then, aim to bring your utilization below 30%. To calculate your credit utilization, divide your outstanding balance on each revolving account by its credit limit and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage. Credit scoring systems consider the utilization rate on each account individually and on the total of all accounts, as in the following example: Credit Limit | Balance | Utilization (Balance/Limit) | ---|---|---| Credit card 1 | $6,500 | $1,600 | 25% | ---|---|---|---| Credit card 2 | $4,800 | $1,500 | 31% | ---|---|---|---| Credit card 3 | $8,000 | $1,300 | 16% | ---|---|---|---| Total credit card utilization | $19,300 | $4,400 | 23% | ---|---|---|---| Learn more: Which Debts Should I Pay Off First to Improve
