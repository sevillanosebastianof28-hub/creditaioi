car's safety record and features - How much damage the vehicle is likely to cause in a collision - Whether the car is financed is also a factor; lenders typically insist you carry more than the minimum required amount of insurance.

Some also require personal injury protection insurance to cover medical expenses after an accident. Lenders may have their own insurance requirements for financed vehicles. Beyond these basic requirements, you can purchase additional insurance, such as comprehensive and collision coverage, for greater protection. You can also opt for more liability or personal injury coverage than your state's minimums, and add extras like rental car coverage or windshield glass coverage. Typically, premiums rise as you add more coverage. Learn more: How Much Car Insurance Do I Need? Stop overpaying for insurance 8. Your Deductible The deductible is the amount you must pay out of pocket when you file a car insurance claim. For instance, if you choose a deductible of $500, you'll need to pay that amount for damages when you file a claim, before your insurance kicks in. How a deductible works: Damages in filed claim: $3,000 Deductible amount: $500 Total amount insurance company will cover: $2,500 ($3,000 - $500) Car insurance policies usually offer deductibles ranging from $0 to $2,500. Opting for a higher deductible can lower your insurance premiums. However, avoid raising your deductible beyond what you could afford to pay if you had an insurance claim. 9. Your Vehicle Usage Statistically, the more time you spend on the road, the more likely you are to get into a car accident. As a result, high-mileage drivers (typically defined as driving 15,000 miles or more annually) may pay more for car insurance. Those who drive less than 12,000 or 10,000 miles per year, on the other hand, are often eligible for lower rates. A driver with a daily commute usually pays higher premiums than someone who only drives for pleasure. If you don't drive much, choosing low-mileage car insurance options such as pay-per-mile auto insurance or usage-based insurance could mean significant savings. 10. Your Claims History and Insurance History Car insurance companies examine your history of filing claims when setting premiums. Having many claims suggests that you're likely to file more claims in the future. Insurers usually increase your rates to compensate for this risk. You might also pay higher premiums if you've ever gone without car insurance (known as a lapse in coverage) or have failed to pay your premiums. 11. Your Insurance Company Each insurance company sets its own rates. Different providers may charge different premiums for the same kind and amount of coverage. If your current rates are too high, getting quotes online from several insurance companies can give you an idea of the savings each insurer might offer. Be careful to compare the same type and amount of coverage. Price is just one consideration when purchasing car insurance, however. You should also investigate each company's financial stability and check customer reviews to see how well they handle claims. Learn more: How To Choose The Best Car Insurance Company 12. Your Credit Score Insurance companies in most states can consider your credit score when calculating your car insurance premiums. A higher score typically translates to lower premiums. The credit-based insurance score insurers use differs from the scores lenders use. However, it's based on similar information, so checking your regular credit score can give you an idea of how your credit-based insurance score might impact your car insurance costs.
