a credit card that doesn't focus on your credit history. Debit-credit hybrid cards may be another option, as they generally don't require a credit check when you apply. Get a Retail Credit Card Store credit cards offered by retailers and gas stations typically have less stringent credit requirements than traditional credit cards. If you shop regularly with a specific retailer, you can also take advantage of rewards, discounts, free shipping and other perks. That said, credit limits are usually low, so it can be easy to rack up a high credit utilization rate, which can hurt your credit. Additionally, many store credit cards restrict you to using them only with the co-branded retailer, limiting your spending options. If you have issues with overspending, the extra perks could make it difficult to stay within your budget. Become an Authorized User If you have a loved one who uses their credit card responsibly, consider asking them to add you as an authorized user on their account. With authorized-user status, the entire account history will show up on your credit reports. If the primary cardholder makes payments on time and keeps their credit utilization low, it could help you establish a positive history and give your credit scores a boost. Get Credit for Other On-Time Payments Historically, monthly obligations like rent, utility bills, phone bills and insurance premiums haven't been included in consumer credit reports. However, Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸ now makes it possible to add these and even streaming service payments to your Experian credit file. After registering for the free feature, you'll link your bank accounts and select which bills you want to include. Once you confirm, your credit scores could see an instant increase.

With this type of loan, the lender holds the loan proceedsâusually $300 to $1,000âin a savings account while you make payments over a period of six to 24 months. The lender reports your payments to the credit bureaus, and then disburses the loan funds to you once you complete your repayment term. Credit-builder loans typically charge lower interest rates than secured credit cards, but you'll still want to make sure you find a monthly payment that works with your budget. How to Build Credit With a Credit Card If you get approved for a credit card, it's important to develop good credit habits as quickly as possible to ensure a positive credit history. Here are some steps you can take: Spend on a budget. If you don't already have one, create a budget to ensure that you don't spend more than you can afford to pay in full each month. Paying your balance off every month not only helps you avoid interest charges but can also prevent your credit card debt from getting out of hand. - Keep your utilization rate low. Because starter credit cards often offer a low credit limit, it can be easy to use up a significant portion of your available credit with just a few purchases. Consider using your card infrequently or making multiple payments throughout the month to keep your utilization rate low. - Always pay on time. Your payment history is the most important factor in your credit score, so it's imperative that you always pay your bill on time. If you miss a payment by 30 days or more, it could cause significant, lasting damage to your credit score. To ensure on-time payment, consider setting up autopay on your account. If you'd rather pay manually, set up an alert for your due date. - Keep the account active.
