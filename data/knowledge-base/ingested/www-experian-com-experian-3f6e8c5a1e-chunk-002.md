In addition to these balances, your statement lists a minimum monthly payment. This is the least you can pay in a billing cycle and still keep your account in good standing. Card issuers may calculate the minimum payment based on a flat percentage of your balance or based on a percentage plus interest and fees.

Your credit utilization is the amount of revolving credit you're using relative to your available credit. To find your credit utilization ratio, divide your total credit card balances by your total credit limits, then multiply by 100. Example: If you have two credit cards with a $3,000 credit limit on each, one with a $1,000 balance and the other with a $500 balance, your credit utilization is 25% ($1,500 / $6,000 = 25%). A lower credit utilization ratio is better for your credit score. People with the highest credit scores generally have credit utilization ratios under 10%. Although there's no exact point at which credit utilization flips from good to bad, a ratio exceeding 30% typically starts to weigh more heavily on your credit score.

With the debt snowball approach, you make minimum payments on all your credit cards, then put any extra you can afford toward the card with the smallest balance. Once that card is paid off, add what you were paying on the first card to the minimum balance on the card with the next smallest balance, and so on until all your cards are paid off. - Use the debt avalanche method. The debt avalanche method focuses on paying down the balances with the highest interest rates first. After making minimum payments on all your cards, put any extra money toward the one with the highest annual percentage rate (APR). Focus on paying this card down first, followed by the card with the next-highest rate and so on. - Get a balance transfer card.
