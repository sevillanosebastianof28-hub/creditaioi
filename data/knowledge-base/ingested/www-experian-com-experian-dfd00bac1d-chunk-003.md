Your Credit Score Insurance companies in most states can consider your credit score when calculating your car insurance premiums. A higher score typically translates to lower premiums. The credit-based insurance score insurers use differs from the scores lenders use. However, it's based on similar information, so checking your regular credit score can give you an idea of how your credit-based insurance score might impact your car insurance costs. How to Lower Your Car Insurance Rates Some factors affecting your car insurance premiums are outside your control, but there are still several steps you can take to lower your costs. Investigate discounts. Check to see what discounts each insurance carrier offers. You might be eligible for the following common discounts on car insurance: Being a high school or college student with good grades - Paying your annual premium upfront - Setting up auto payments - Getting digital instead of paper statements - Belonging to organizations or working for employers that offer insurance discounts as a perk - Driving fewer than 12,000 miles annually - Owning a home - Having a vehicle with factory-installed anti-theft or safety equipment - Remaining with the same insurer for a certain number of years - - Cut back on coverage. Dropping unnecessary coverage, such as roadside assistance or rental car reimbursement, can save you money. If your car is paid off and you could afford to replace it, see how much eliminating collision and comprehensive coverage might save. - Increase your deductible. Raising your deductible generally lowers your insurance premiums. Just make sure you have enough savings to pay your deductible in case of a claim. - Drive safely. Avoiding speeding tickets, aggressive driving and other risky behavior can reduce the cost of car insurance. Some insurance companies lower your rates if you stay accident-free or complete a defensive driving course. - Drive less. Reducing your mileage generally saves you money. Investigate pay-per-mile auto insurance or usage-based car insurance, which may save you even more if you're willing to have your driving habits monitored. - Bundle insurance policies. Purchasing two or more insurance policies from the same provider, such as home and auto coverage, is known as bundling and typically earns a discount. - Comparison shop. Shop around for car insurance once a year or so to see if you can get a better price. You can compare car insurance costs quickly by using an online marketplace to get quotes from multiple providers in one place. Experian's car insurance quote comparison tool gathers prices from top insurance carriers for your current auto insurance coverage, so it's easy to see if you can save. - Frequently Asked Questions The Bottom Line Improving your credit score may help lower your car insurance rates. Paying down high-interest debt, bringing late accounts current and paying your bills on time can all help boost your credit score. Set up free credit monitoring to track your progress. A good credit score can make it easier to qualify for credit cards and loans at lower interest rates, saving you money on more than just auto insurance.
