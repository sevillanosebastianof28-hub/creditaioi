How to Contact the Credit Bureaus Quick Answer You can contact the credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) online, by phone or by mail. Learn how to check your credit, make inquiries, submit disputes, activate a security freeze and apply a fraud alert with Experian. The three national consumer credit bureaus, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax, provide several ways you can check your credit information. In addition to requesting your credit report and credit score, you can contact the bureaus to access tools that help protect your identity, address any inaccuracies in your credit report and more. Here's what you need to know to contact the three national credit bureaus.

The free account also includes access to a FICOÂ® ScoreÎ with daily updates and credit monitoring that alerts you to new activity on your Experian credit report. You may also request a hard copy of your Experian credit report by calling 888-397-3742. In addition, you are legally entitled to download a free copy of your credit reports from each of the three national credit bureaus once weekly at AnnualCreditReport.com. You may also submit a request form to receive hard copies of those credit reports by mail. Check Your Credit Score You can get your FICOÂ® Score with daily updates by enrolling in a free Experian account. Each score includes a list of score risk factors, based on your individual credit history, that can help explain your score and how you might improve your score in the future. Make General Inquiries To request basic information or learn more about Experian practices and policies, you can: Visit the Experian Contact Us page to learn about several options for reaching out to the company - Go to the Experian YouTube channel for credit tips and additional information - Connect with Experian on social media at Facebook, Instagram or X - File a Dispute If you believe your Experian credit report contains an inaccuracy, you have the right to file a dispute to correct the record. The Experian Dispute Center lets you submit a dispute electronically, enables you to upload digital documents related to your dispute and furnishes status updates on pending disputes. This page also provides instructions and downloadable forms you can use to file a dispute through postal mail. Experian welcomes credit report disputes by phone, but recommends obtaining a credit report first and then calling the phone number provided on the report.

This can be done through the Experian credit freeze page, where you'll also find instructions for removing a freeze, suspending (or "thawing") a freeze temporarily and for giving a lender one-time access to your frozen credit report. You may also request to freeze (or thaw) your Experian credit report by calling 888-397-3742 or by sending a request in writing to: Experian P.O. Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013 Keep in mind that a credit freeze can restrict both unauthorized and legitimate access to your credit reports.
