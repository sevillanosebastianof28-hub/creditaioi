auto loans directly from banks, credit unions or online lenders. Before visiting the dealership, it's smart to shop around for direct auto loans and get preapproved, which can give you more bargaining power at the dealership. - Dealer-arranged financing: Many dealerships arrange financing by submitting your loan application to several lenders. Some also offer financing through the manufacturer's financing company. - Personal check: Most dealerships take personal checks for either your down payment or the full purchase price of the car. However, temporary checks, or checks from someone other than the car buyer, may be rejected. - Cashier's check: You can pay cash for your car by purchasing a cashier's check from your bank in the amount you want and taking it to the dealership. Cashier's checks are guaranteed by the issuing bank, giving the dealership confidence that the check will clear. - Wire transfer: Electronically transferring money from your bank account to the dealership via wire transfer is a safe way to pay with cash; however, it typically involves fees. - Credit card: If your credit limit is high enough, some dealerships let you use a credit card to make a down payment or even pay for the car in full, but since dealers pay processing fees on credit card transactions, they may limit the amount you can charge. Buying a car with a credit card generally only makes sense if you have a rewards card and pay the balance off right away. Otherwise, a large balance on your card could spike your credit utilization ratio, which may negatively impact your credit score. - Learn more: What Are the Different Types of Car Loans? The Bottom Line You can buy a car with a debit card if the dealer allows it and the purchase is within your spending limits. If you can qualify for low interest rates, financing the car may be a better option than paying cash. However, if auto loan rates are high or you prefer to avoid debt, paying cash for the car may make more sense for you. Having good credit could help you secure a lower interest rate on your auto loan. You can check your FICOÂ® ScoreÎ for free from Experian and see what you can do to improve it.
