Hello, how can we help? What should I do if I think someone is using my personal information? Where can I find out more about identity theft and protecting my identity? What is identity theft? How secure is the information I provide to Equifax.com? Does placing a fraud alert hurt my credit scores? Can Equifax assist consumers who are deaf or hard of hearing? Am I better off placing a fraud alert, requesting a security freeze, or obtaining a credit report lock? How do I place a fraud alert or an active duty alert? How can I remove a fraud alert or active duty alert? How do I update fraud alert or active duty alert contact information on my Equifax credit report? What is a fraud alert? If I don't create a myEquifax account, are there other ways I can place a security freeze, fraud alert or active duty alert? What rights do I have under the Fair Credit Reporting Act if I have been a victim of ID theft? What documentation should I send in to validate my ID or address?
