What Is Experian BoostÂ®? Quick Answer Experian BoostÂ® is a free feature that could improve your credit scores by adding household bill payments to your Experian credit file. Eligible payments may include utility, cable, internet, streaming, insurance and online rent payments. Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸ is a first-of-its-kind feature that could help consumers instantly improve their FICOÂ® ScoreÎ by giving them credit for eligible on-time utility, phone and certain rent, insurance and streaming service payments. Experian Boost is good for people with little to no credit history as well as established borrowers looking to increase their credit scores. Here's what you need to know. What Is Experian Boost? Experian Boost is a free feature that lets you add your on-time payment history of certain household bills to your Experian credit file to help you build credit. Eligible payments may include: Phone bills (mobile and landline) - Utility bills (gas, water, electricity, solar) - Insurance (excluding health insurance) - Residential rent (if paid online) - Internet, cable and satellite providers - Streaming services - These payments can be reliable indicators of responsible financial management and creditworthiness, but, because they are not considered debt payments, they are not traditionally reported to the consumer credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax). Adding these payments to your Experian credit file allows them to contribute to your FICOÂ® Scores based on Experian credit data. Learn more: What Affects Your Credit Scores? How Does Experian Boost Work? Experian Boost works by giving you credit for the payments you're already making. Normally, utility, phone, insurance, streaming and rent payments do not factor into your credit scores. When you connect your accounts to Experian Boost, however, Experian uses your connected accounts to find on-time qualifying payments for these monthly bills. Once you verify the information and agree to add it to your Experian credit file, you may instantly receive an updated FICOÂ® Score. The process takes about five minutes, and any change to your FICOÂ® Score will happen immediately. By adding these records to your Experian credit file, Experian Boost helps you build positive payment history. Payment history is the most important factor in calculating your credit scores, so adding records of on-time payments could be very valuable. Keep in mind, Experian Boost only considers positive payment history on these accounts, so late payments will not lower your credit scores. Tip: The length of your credit history also plays a role in your credit scores. Adding more accounts to your Experian credit file with Experian Boost helps you build credit history by showing more evidence of active accounts and on-time payments.
