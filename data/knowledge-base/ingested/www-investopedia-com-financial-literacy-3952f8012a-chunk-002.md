A lawsuit settlement loan is a type of short term lump sum loan made by a lender to a borrower who expects to receive a reward settlement as part of a class action lawsuit or personal injury lawsuit. Once a legal settlement is made to the borrower the loan is repaid with interest. Lawsuit settlement loans typically have higher interest rates compared to traditional personal loans. A stretch loan is a short-term form of borrowing meant to cover a shortfall in income. Stretch loans are similar to payday loans and carry higher interest rates than traditional personal loans that have longer repayment terms. A cash advance is a very short term loan made through a bank, credit union, credit card issuer or non-traditional financial institution and is often used to cover immediate cash needs resulting from unexpected financial demands such as medical expenses or car repairs. Payday loans are a form of short term credit that are typically offered by non-traditional consumer finance companies and carry very high interest rates. The principal of payday loans can be a portion or more of the borrowers next paycheck. Payday loan interest rates are determined by the borrowers income but tend to be among the highest rates charged in the financial markets.
