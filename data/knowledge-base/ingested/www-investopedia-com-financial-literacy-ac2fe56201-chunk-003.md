Charles Schwab: Best for Beginners 4.7 Open an Account Account Minimum: $0 Fees: $0 for stock/ETF trades, $0.65 per contract for options Read full review Open an Account Why We Chose It Even before TD Ameritrade’s educational content was incorporated into its ecosystem, Charles Schwab—which acquired TD Ameritrade in 2020—was known as one of the best platforms for new traders and investors. With the integration now complete, Schwab has taken over the top ranks in this category, a position TD Ameritrade used to dominate. Schwab now houses the most comprehensive library of evergreen learning materials, along with seemingly endless coaching programs and regularly scheduled live training events, making it the best for beginner investors. Pros & Cons Pros Industry-leading educational content Multiple user-friendly platforms Superb ETF research and scanners Over 420 branches in 48 states Access to the highly regarded thinkorswim® platform Cons Relatively high margin rates Low interest earned on uninvested cash Lacks fractional ETF trading No direct investments in cryptocurrencies In the News On July 21, 2025, Charles Schwab announced a significant expansion to the list of securities that users of the company's thinkorswim platform can now trade overnight. Schwab retail clients can now trade more than 1,100 securities, primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 24 hours a day, five days a week, using extended + overnight session orders (EXTO). EXTO orders are continuous orders that expire at 8 p.m. ET each market day. Overview Chuck Schwab and his partners formed First Commander Corporation in April 1971, and later changed the company’s name to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. in 1973. Charles Schwab has since grown into a household name in the brokerage industry and, in October 2020, completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, with full client integration finalized by mid-2024. Not only does Schwab provide the right mix of usability, tools, education, and research to its diverse customer base, but it does so across multiple top-tier platforms. As of Oct. 20, 2025, Schwab’s total client assets stood at $11.59 trillion. With Schwab’s integration of TD Ameritrade complete, the combination of Schwab’s exceptional lineup of products and services and TD Ameritrade’s powerful trading capabilities has boosted the company even closer to the top of our comprehensive rating model. One of the most anticipated additions to Schwab's lineup occurred on April 11, 2024, with the company announcing that futures and forex trading, along with a new Portfolio Margin feature, have been made available on its thinkorswim platform. On Oct. 30, 2024, the company announced even more exciting news when it introduced overnight trading in S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100-traded stocks, as well as hundreds of additional exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 24 hours a day, five days a week (24/5). On Feb. 12, 2025, the company made overnight trading available to all clients via the thinkorswim platform. Prospective customers should note, however, that crypto spot trading still isn’t available, but spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are offered.
