Getting help from or communicating with the LII "Help" is a pretty broad term, covering everything from technical assistance in using some part of the LII site to assistance with complex, personal legal matters. We should probably state right at the outset that the LII cannot offer you legal advice or assistance, and we do not offer personalized help with legal research or school projects. Our friends at Justia offer a lawyer directory for paid legal services, and the US Department of Justice offers a geographical directory of Pro Bono (free) legal service providers. (But read on, because there may be other ways in which we can help you.) The reasons for this are both legal and practical. First, it is illegal for us to do anything that any state or jurisdiction might interpret as "practicing law" --and that includes giving advice or interpreting the law. Second, even if we could do so legally, we would quickly drown in the volume of requests. This site is visited by literally hundreds of thousands of people each week. We get many, many e-mailed requests for help, and we cannot answer even a small portion of them.What we can do is offer you some generic help on topics people commonly ask about, as a way of helping you get started. Web accessibility help For web accessibility help, please refer to the LII Web Accessibility page. Broken links, missing data, or other problems with accessing content Before you report a problem, you should make sure that it is in fact a problem with the LII site. People often report problems with sites we link to, problems that lie beyond our site and beyond our control. If it is an LII problem, the page containing the broken link or other problem should show words ".law.cornell.edu" in the part of your browser that tells you what page you're looking at. In reporting a problem, please tell us what page you were viewing when you encountered it. There are over 100,000 pages on the LII site, and it is difficult for us to find a particular broken link or other problem unless you tell us where it is. Problems can be reported with the "problems" category in the contact form. Different things may happen once you report the problem. Some broken links we fix immediately, because we recognize that they are heavily used and relied upon. Others we put on a list to be fixed as part of our regular maintenance activities during the summer months (we are very thinly staffed). Most problems with dysfunctional scripts or software are fixed right away, the exception being when we have a major overhaul of a software subsystem pending within a reasonable time. Locating laws, cases, and rules Legal research is a highly specialized and sometimes difficult topic that we can't hope to cover thoroughly here. We can, however, offer some tips based on our experience with what people commonly ask about. You may also want to look at our section on help with legal problems. Here, in no particular order, are some tips: General hints: At this writing there is no really first-class guide to legal research for the lay person online; most are just lists of resources. Some you might try have been written by a branch of the New York Public Library and by Nolo Press. You might also try the Layperson's Law Lounge. Finally, don't ignore print sources; any good bookstore either on- or offline will stock a number of self-help legal guides. - More specialized "getting started" guides for legal research are available for government information , for courts, and for reports of jury verdicts and damages. For a good tutorial on Internet searching in general, see Web Search Strategies. The language is a little ornate but the advice is good. - Finding laws, rules,
