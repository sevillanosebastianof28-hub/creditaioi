What Is a Bankruptcy Discharge? Quick Answer A bankruptcy discharge is a court order that eliminates certain debts after you file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Learn how bankruptcy discharges work, which debts may qualify and how a discharge affects your credit. A bankruptcy discharge is a federal court order that releases you from having to pay certain debts after filing for Chapter 13 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy and successfully completing the requirements. Debt discharge helps protect borrowers who are overwhelmed with debt from financial ruin, but not all debts can be discharged through bankruptcy. How Does a Bankruptcy Discharge Work? If you file for bankruptcy protection and fulfill the court's requirements, your eligible debts will be discharged. You will no longer be legally obligated to repay them, and your creditors must stop trying to collect them. All types of bankruptcy proceedings require completing a credit education course. Chapter 7 Bankruptcy To file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, sometimes called a liquidation bankruptcy, you must prove through a means test that your income is below the median for your state, and forfeit any property that can't be exempted under your state laws. A court-appointed trustee will oversee the sale of that property and distribute the proceeds among your creditors. Debts designated as priority under bankruptcy laws are paid first; any remaining funds will be distributed to the rest of your creditors. Once this process is finishedâtypically within four to six monthsâany eligible debts that are still unpaid will be discharged. Chapter 13 Bankruptcy If a means test shows that you have enough income to repay all or part of your debts, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding sets up a payment plan lasting from three to five years. During that time, you make regular fixed payments to a bankruptcy trustee, who distributes the funds among your creditors. If you successfully complete the payment plan, any eligible debts still unpaid at the end of the repayment period will be discharged.
