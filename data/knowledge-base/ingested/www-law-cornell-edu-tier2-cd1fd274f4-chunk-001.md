Our Financial Model LII does not receive funding from Cornell University. In other words, while Cornell provides us with invaluable access to brilliant students in many disciplines, some office and meeting space, and the gravitas of a top-tier, Ivy League University, it no longer pays our bills and hasn’t for several years. We do that ourselves through contributions from users of our website, project partnerships, and various admirers of our mission. Together, that income allows us to operate without direct cost to our parent institution.
