and ability to repay a loan. Lenders will typically require you to provide official documents like PDF statements (not screenshots) you've downloaded directly from your bank. Examples of proof may include: Recent bank or investment account statements - Tax returns - Benefit award letters - Court orders for alimony or child support - Lenders may request additional documentation. Responding quickly avoids delays in processing your application. Assess Existing Debts When you don't have a job, your existing debtsâcredit card, auto loan, student loan and mortgage paymentsâcan make it harder to qualify for a loan.

Lenders are more likely to deny a loan application if a significant amount of your current income is committed to other debt payments. Adding another payment to a heavy debt loan increases the risk that you'll default. Compare personal loan rates Find APRs from 4.99% to 35.99% and flexible terms of 12 to 120 months.

If you think there's a risk you can't make your loan payments, consider borrowing less or exploring other options. - Timeframe: Personal loan terms typically range from one to seven years.
