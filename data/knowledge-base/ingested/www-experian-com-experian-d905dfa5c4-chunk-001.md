Type of Budget | Definition | ---|---| 50/30/20 budget | Allocates 50% of income to needs, 30% to wants and 20% to savings and debt repayment | Zero-based budget | Every dollar of income is assigned a specific purpose so at the end of the month you have zero dollars left | Envelope budget | Cash is divided into envelopes for each spending category; when an envelope is empty, spending stops | Pay-yourself-first budget | Prioritizes saving by allocating a portion of income to savings or debt before any other expenses | "No-budget" budget | A relaxed approach where you only track "must pay" necessary expenses and are free to spend the rest of your income as you wish | 50/30/20 Budget The 50/30/20 budget allocates your money into three main categories: Basic needs: 50%. This includes essential expenses, such as housing, groceries, child care and utilities. - Wants: 30%. These nonessential expenses, or discretionary spending, include going out to eat, entertainment, traveling or any spending that goes beyond your basic needs. - Savings and debt payoff: 20%. This goes toward paying off debt and building savings. - You can easily adjust the 50/30/20 percentages to fit your goals and finances.

Using a 50/30/20 budget, you allocate $3,000 for your essential expenses, $1,800 for discretionary expenses and $1,200 to savings and debt payoff. Learn more: What Is the 50/30/20 Budget Rule?

Basic categories include essential and nonessential expenses, savings and debt payoff. However, you'll probably want to break these categories down in more detail. For example, you might budget $1,000 for rent, $120 for utilities, $323 for your car payment and so on. If you spend more than you've budgeted in one category, you'll need to stop spending or take money from another category to avoid going into the red. For instance, if you run out of grocery money, you could move funds from your entertainment budget to buy food. Zero-based budgeting can help you gain control of your money and stop overspending.
