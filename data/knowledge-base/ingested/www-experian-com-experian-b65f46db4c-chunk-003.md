examples of documents we do not accept. If I uploaded my document today, how quickly will you update my credit report? Disputes are processed within 5 business days from the day we receive your request. It may take up to 30 days for the data furnisher to investigate the dispute and respond. We will notify you once we receive their response. I don't have a Report Number. Can I still upload my documents? Yes; however, it's always best to review a current copy of your credit report prior to initiating a dispute. How will I know you received my uploaded documents? If your documents are uploaded correctly, you will receive a confirmation message telling you so. If not, a message will display that tells you we were unable to upload your document.
