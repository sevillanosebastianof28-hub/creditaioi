How to Get a $5,000 Personal Loan Quick Answer To get a $5,000 personal loan, review the requirements, check your credit score, prequalify with several lenders and apply when youâve found the loan that best suits you. To get a $5,000 personal loan, check your credit, know the requirements and get prequalified with several lenders before formally applying with the lender you've chosen. Personal loan terms can vary widely, so look closely at the interest rate, repayment term, origination fee and other conditions of the loans you're considering. You'll also have the opportunity to choose between secured and unsecured loans and fixed and variable interest rates. Here's a step-by-step guide for how to get a $5,000 personal loan that fits your needs. Where Can I Get a $5,000 Loan? You can get a personal loan from the following types of lenders: Credit unions: Since credit unions are not-for-profit, member-owned cooperatives, they typically offer personal loans at lower interest rates and with more accessible eligibility requirements than other institutions. You'll need to join a credit union as a member in order to apply for a personal loan there. But there's often a low barrier to entry, such as paying a one-time $5 to $25 membership fee or depositing as little as $5 in a savings account. - Banks: Traditional banks also offer personal loans. They might have tighter eligibility requirements and higher interest rates. But if you already bank with a particular institution, it's worth looking into their loan options in case they offer existing customers special loan products or deals. - Online lenders: If you're comfortable applying for a personal loan completely online, lenders without brick-and-mortar locations may offer faster funding and lower rates. - Learn more: Personal Loan Requirements to Know Before You Apply Compare personal loan rates Find APRs from 4.99% to 35.99% and flexible terms of 12 to 120 months.
