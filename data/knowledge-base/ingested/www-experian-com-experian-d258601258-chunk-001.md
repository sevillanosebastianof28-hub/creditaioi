How to Build Credit: A Comprehensive Guide Quick Answer Some steps you can take to build credit include paying your bills on time, minimizing unnecessary debt, maintaining a diverse mix of credit and monitoring your credit score over time. Building a good credit score can take time, but the benefits of doing so are numerous. Even if you don't expect to apply for credit anytime soon, working on it now can help ensure you have a good score when you need it. Ultimately, the steps you take to build credit should be based on your unique situation and credit profile. However, there are some general guidelines you can follow to build and maintain a good credit score. Here's what you need to know about the different factors that determine your credit score, plus how to start building credit. How Does Credit Work? Your credit history is a reflection of how you've managed debt in the past and is primarily represented by your credit reports and credit scores. Your credit reports contain information reported by your creditors that credit scoring models then use to calculate your scores. Here's a deeper look at how credit works and what to pay attention to as you build your credit history. Types of Credit Credit accounts come in many forms, but when it comes to your credit reports and scores, there are three major types of credit that you will encounter: Revolving credit: Revolving credit accounts come with a line of credit that you can draw on, pay back and draw on again. Credit cards and lines of credit are the most popular forms of revolving credit. - Installment credit: Installment credit provides you with a lump-sum disbursement, which you pay back in fixed monthly installments. This includes personal loans, student loans, auto loans and mortgages. - Service credit: Service credit is the type of account you have with anyone who provides you with a service and bills you monthly. Your utility and cellphone bills are examples of service credit accounts (which you can also add to your Experian credit file with Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸). - Getting a credit card is one of the most common ways to begin building credit, but it's not the only way. Here are two approaches to building credit: How to Build Credit With a Credit Card | How to Build Credit Without a Credit Card | ---|---| Open your first credit card | Pay your loans on time | Become an authorized user | Consider an installment loan | Pay your bills on time | Add monthly bills to your Experian credit report | Maintain a low credit utilization rate | Request a credit limit increase | How to Build Credit With a Credit Card Credit cards are one of the best credit-building tools available, primarily because they make it possible to establish a positive credit history without paying interest.

However, if you rack up a large balance or miss a payment, it could leave you worse off than before. Here are four strategies for responsibly building good credit using a credit card.
