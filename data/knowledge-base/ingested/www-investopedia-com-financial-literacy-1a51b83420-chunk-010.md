Common Debt Relief Terms to Understand If you are considering working with a debt relief company, you should familiarize yourself with these common terms: Creditor: A creditor is the institution that holds your debt. It is who you owe money to. Creditors will try to collect on the debt you owe, even if you are working with a debt relief company, but they may be willing to accept less than the full amount. Unsecured debt: If you are working with a debt relief company, it is for unsecured debt, which is not tied to any physical property. A car loan or a home mortgage, for example, is considered a secured debt, because the car or home secures the loan and can be taken by the creditor. Bankruptcy: Working with a debt relief company is a way to avoid bankruptcy, which is a legal process that discharges your debt in the extreme event that you cannot repay it. Bankruptcy is more damaging to a person's credit score than settling debts for less than what you owe. Debt consolidation: An alternative to working with a debt relief company is a debt consolidation loan. In this case, you would obtain a single loan, preferably with a lower interest rate than what you are paying on your outstanding debts, and use those funds to pay off your other loans. The goal is to consolidate multiple loans into a single loan with a lower monthly payment than your previous loans combined. Financial plan: In addition to working with a debt relief company, it's important to have a financial plan for long-term financial health. More than just a budget, it helps to identify financial goals for the short-term and the long-term and establishes a framework for reaching those goals.
