be ad valorem (a percentage of the cost) or specific (a set dollar amount). Excise taxes levied on goods with a high social cost such as alcohol and tobacco are known as sin taxes. Motor fuels, airline tickets, and health services are other major sources of excise tax revenue. These taxes are paid by the manufacturer or retailer, not the consumer, but are passed on to the consumer in the form of higher costs. Excise taxes on fuel, alcohol, and tobacco are one example of an indirect tax. So are import duties paid by those who import goods from outside the country. A consumption tax imposed on goods and services, a sales tax is paid at the point of sale by the consumer and is collected by the seller. A manufacturer at an interim step in the manufacturing process (say a yarn maker who sells the yarn to a sweater manufacturer) can obtain a certificate of resale to avoid being charged sales tax on the yarn. This is any tax on the purchase of goods and services. Sales taxes, excise taxes and tariffs are all consumption taxes. They are taxes on what you spend, rather than taxes on what you earn (income taxes). Income or transactions that aren’t subject to any federal, state, or local tax are tax exempt. Some religious and charitable organizations are also tax exempt. So are earnings from municipal bonds.
