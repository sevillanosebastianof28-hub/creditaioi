out a loan for discretionary purchases, such as a vacation or shopping, you could end up paying significant interest charges over time. That might be considered a poor use of debt. A debt that has a high interest rate or fees could also be considered bad debt, even if you use the debt for an essential purchase. One way to compare loans is to calculate the annual percentage rate (APR) of the various options to see which one will cost more on an annualized basis. A loan's APR considers the interest rate, certain fees and repayment term. APR calculator Examples of Bad Debt Some common examples of bad debt include: Credit card debt: Credit cards often have high interest rates, so carrying credit card balances (instead of paying them off each month) could be considered bad debt. - High-interest loans: Loans that have unusually high fees or interest rates include high-rate installment loans that you find online, payday loans and auto title loans. - Debt for discretionary spending: Taking out a loan to pay for a vacation, designer clothing, hobbies or other discretionary spending could be considered bad debt. - It's often best to avoid certain types of loans and borrowing money when you don't need to. Otherwise, you could wind up in a debt cycle, where you have to continually take out new loans to afford all your bills. Somewhere-in-the-Middle Debt Sometimes, debt falls into a gray areaâit's not quite good or bad. For example, credit card debt is often considered bad debt. However, you won't have to pay interest on your purchases if you pay your credit card bill in full each month. You also might get a card that has a 0% intro APR offer and you can pay off your purchase over time without paying any extra fees or interest. Debt that doesn't accrue interest generally falls under good debt. Buy now, pay later (BNPL) plans could also be good debt because they let you pay off purchases without any added interest or fees. But taking on too many BNPLs or using BNPLs to purchase things you couldn't otherwise afford could lead to trouble. Even a vehicle loan could be in the gray zone. It might be considered good debt if you get a low interest rate and use the loan to purchase a primary vehicle. But it might be considered bad debt if you're borrowing money to buy a second car or a boat, and the loan payments make covering your day-to-day expenses difficult. Often, the specific terms, how you're using the money and the entirety of your financial situation determine if a new debt will be good or bad. How to Avoid Bad Debt Avoiding bad debt is sometimes a choiceâyou can decide whether you'll borrow money to pay for a vacation or wait until you save up enough. Other times, you might have to take on high-interest loans to care for your family and pay for necessary expenses. You can try to avoid either situation if you: Create a budget. Following a budget, even a bare-bones one, can help you identify how much you need for necessary expensesâand you might discover you're spending more than you expected on certain discretionary expenses. You may be able to find ways to save money and use those savings rather than taking on debt. - Improve your credit. A good credit score can help you qualify for credit cards and loans with favorable terms. If you focus on paying your bills on time, using credit accounts could help you build credit. You can also look for ways to build credit without taking on new debts, such as using Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸ to add eligible rent, utility, streaming service and insurance payments to your Experian credit report. - Build an emergency fund.
