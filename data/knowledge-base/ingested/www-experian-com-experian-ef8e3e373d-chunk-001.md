How to Buy a Used Car Quick Answer There are a few things to check before buying a used car. Review the vehicle history report, inspect the car's condition, take a test drive and secure financing before signing any paperwork. Buying a used car can save you thousands of dollars compared to buying new, but it requires more legwork to ensure you're getting a reliable vehicle at a fair price. There are a few things to check before buying a used car, including the vehicle history report, overall condition, financing terms and the seller's reputation. Whether you're purchasing from a dealer or a private seller, following a careful process can help you avoid costly mistakes and drive away with confidence. What to Look for When Buying a Used Car Before committing to any vehicle, take time to evaluate its condition thoroughly. Here's what to examine: Vehicle history report: A vehicle history report reveals critical details about the car's past, including accident history, title status, odometer readings and previous ownership. Services like Carfax and AutoCheck provide these reports using the vehicle identification number (VIN) or license plate number. - Body alignment and paint: Walk around the car and look for uneven gaps between body panels, mismatched paint colors or signs of rust. These could indicate previous collision damage or poor repairs. - Tires: Check the tread depth on all four tires and look for uneven wear patterns. Uneven wear may signal alignment issues, improper inflation or suspension problems that could lead to expensive repairs. - Under the hood: Look for signs of leaks, corrosion on the battery terminals and worn belts or hoses. Also, check the oil dipstickâmilky oil could indicate a blown head gasket. - Interior condition: Inspect the seats, carpet and headliner for rips, stains or excessive wear. Test all the controls, including windows, locks, seat adjustments and climate controls. - Electronics and infotainment: Make sure the dashboard displays work properly, the radio functions and any smartphone connectivity features respond correctly. You can also bring your phone and a cable to test the connection. - Brakes: During the test drive, listen for squealing or grinding sounds when braking. The car should stop smoothly without pulling to one side. - Suspension: Pay attention to how the car handles bumps and turns. Excessive bouncing, clunking sounds or a rough ride could indicate worn shocks or struts. - Compare rates on a new auto loan Find a good auto loan with todayâs rates.

How to Buy a Used Car From a Dealer Buying from a dealership offers certain conveniences and protections, but you'll want to be thorough with your research and negotiations. Here's a step-by-step guide. 1. Set a Budget Start by determining how much you can afford to spend. If you're paying cash, consider how much of your savings you can use while still maintaining an emergency fund. If you plan to finance the purchase, evaluate your monthly budget to determine a comfortable payment amount. A common guideline is to keep your total monthly car expensesâincluding the payment, insurance and fuelâbelow 10% to 20% of your monthly take-home pay. You'll also want to plan for a down payment of at least 10%, which can help you qualify for better loan terms and reduce your monthly payments. Learn more: How Much Is a Down Payment on a Car? 2. Research Vehicles Think about the features that matter most to you, such as fuel efficiency, cargo space, safety ratings and reliability. Online resources like Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book and Consumer Reports can help you compare different makes and models based on your priorities. Consider the vehicle's age and mileage as well. While older cars with higher mileage typically cost less, they may require more frequent maintenance and repairs down the road.
