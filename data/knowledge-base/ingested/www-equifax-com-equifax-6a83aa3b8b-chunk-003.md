down payment, which is calculated by dividing the amount of the loan by the appraised property value. For example, if you're buying a home valued at $100,000 and you make a 20% down payment ($20,000), the LTV ratio would be $80,000 (the amount of the loan) divided by $100,000, or 80%. If you're able to increase your down payment to 30%, the LTV ratio would drop to 70%, and the lender might offer you a lower interest rate. What other costs should I consider? It's important to note that there are a number of expenses that come with buying a home that have nothing to do with the down payment or the mortgage. These include everything from transfer taxes, attorney fees, title insurance and other closing costs to inspection fees, annual property taxes, homeowners insurance, and ongoing repairs and maintenance. Make sure you look at what you'll have to spend on these additional obligations and account for them as you determine how much house you can afford in terms of a down payment and mortgage.
