statutory interpretation Statutory interpretation, also known as statutory construction, is the process by which courts interpret and apply legislation. While some statutes may have a plain meaning, many contain ambiguity that may need to be resolved by a judge. To determine the meaning of a statute, judges use various tools of interpretation, including traditional canons of statutory interpretation, legislative history, and statutory purpose. In the United States, two primary theories guide statutory interpretation: purposivism and textualism. Both aim to uphold legislative supremacy, and regardless of their theory, judges often use many of the same tools, including: Examining the ordinary meaning of the statutory text. - Considering the broader statutory context. - Applying canons of construction, which are established guides and presumptions for reading statutes. - Reviewing the legislative history of a provision. - Considering how the statute has been implemented. - Although both purposivists and textualists may employ these tools, their interpretive theory can influence the order in which the tools are applied and the weight given to each.
