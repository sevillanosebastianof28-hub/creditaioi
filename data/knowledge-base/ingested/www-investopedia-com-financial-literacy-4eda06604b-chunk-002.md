2,400 new jobs over the 10-year period. Overall, however, this is a relatively small field, with only 33,600 actuaries employed as of 2024. In order to become an actuary, an individual must have a bachelor's degree in actuarial science or some other related field and must pass a series of exams to become certified in the field. Actuaries need a strong background in math, statistics, and business. Salary and job outlook are partly determined by the amount of training and certificates an applicant has, but also by the location of the job and the specific industry that is hiring. Important The metropolitan areas with the highest level of employment for actuaries are New York-Newark-Jersey City, in areas spanning NY, NJ, and PA, followed by Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, in areas spanning IL, IN, and WI. Where the Jobs Are More actuaries will be needed in the health insurance industry to determine the effects of changing healthcare laws. More jobs will also be created in property insurance and casualty insurance to determine the risks to communities prone to more frequent storms and other types of extreme weather. Enterprise risk management, the practice of helping companies manage their own risk, will also boost job opportunities for actuaries.
