(3) The rule of necessity may override the rule of disqualification. (4) Neither the filing of a brief amicus curiae nor the participation of counsel for amicus curiae requires a Justice’s disqualification. (5) A Justice should keep informed about the Justice’s personal and fiduciary financial interests and make a reasonable effort to keep informed about the personal financial interests of the Justice’s spouse and minor children residing in the Justice’s household. (6) For the purposes of this section: (a) The degree of relationship is calculated according to the civil law system; the following relatives are within the third degree of relationship: parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, great grandparent, great grandchild, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, niece, and nephew; the listed relatives include whole and half blood relatives and most step relatives; (b) “fiduciary” includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee, and guardian; (c) “financial interest” means ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small, or a relationship as director, advisor, or other active participant in the affairs of a party, except that: (i) Ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities is not a “financial interest” in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of the fund; (ii) An office in an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization is not a “financial interest” in securities held by the organization; (iii) The proprietary interest of a policyholder in a mutual insurance company, or a depositor in a mutual savings association, or a similar proprietary interest, is a “financial interest” in the organization only if the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect the value of the interest; (iv) Ownership of government securities is a “financial interest” in the issuer only if the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect the value of the securities. (d) “proceeding” includes pretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of litigation. (7) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Canon, if a Justice would be disqualified because of a financial interest in a party (other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required if the Justice (or the Justice’s spouse or minor child) divests the interest that provides the grounds for disqualification.

A Justice may engage in extrajudicial activities, including law-related pursuits and civic, charitable, educational, religious, social, financial, fiduciary, and government activities, and may speak, write, lecture, and teach on both law-related and nonlegal subjects. However, a Justice should not participate in extrajudicial activities that detract from the dignity of the Justice’s office, interfere with the performance of the Justice’s official duties, reflect adversely on the Justice’s impartiality, lead to frequent disqualification, or violate the limitations set forth below. A. Law-Related Activities. (1) Sneaking. Writing, and Teaching. A Justice may speak, write, lecture, teach, and participate in other activities concerning the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice subject to the following limitations and considerations: (a) A Justice should not speak at an event sponsored by or associated with a political party or a campaign for political office.
