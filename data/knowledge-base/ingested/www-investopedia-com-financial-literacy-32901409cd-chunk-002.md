rejected those that did not meet its standards; rates were based on a risk assessment of the property. The Contributionship issued seven-year policies, and claims were paid out of a capital reserve fund. Evolution of Insurance Types in Response to Emerging Risks The Philadelphia Contributionship set new standards for construction because it refused to insure properties it considered fire hazards. The criteria it used to evaluate buildings would one day evolve into both building codes and zoning laws. Seven years later, Franklin was also instrumental in getting the first life insurance company in the U.S., the Presbyterian Ministers' Fund, off the ground. Various religious authorities at the time were outraged at the practice of putting a dollar value on human life, but their criticism cooled with the realization that the payment of death benefits worked to protect widows and orphans. The Industrial Revolution then brought the necessity of both business insurance and disability insurance home to companies and individuals alike. Throughout U.S. history, the types of insurance that companies have offered have expanded in reaction to new risks. For example, in 1897, Travelers Insurance Company sold its first auto insurance policy, and in 1919, its first aircraft liability coverage. As modern life continued to grow more complicated, new types of insurance continued to emerge. Navigating Scandals, Fraud, and Regulatory Changes in Insurance With the rapid growth of insurance companies and insurance products in the late 19th century, the young industry was soon beset by fraud and dubious practices. Scandals ranged from companies that sold policies without having the capital to pay their claims (operating instead like Ponzi schemes) to insurers that ruthlessly forced out competitors in an attempt to create a monopoly. Many states passed laws to address the problems, but in the early 1900s, abuses remained rampant. In 1935, the Social Security Act went into effect, providing for old-age assistance and grants to states for unemployment compensation. Taking away some of the insurance companies' territory, it sent a clear signal that encouraged the industry to begin regulating itself for fear of more government involvement. World War II brought a wage freeze, and employers, desperate to attract the workers still in the country, started offering group life and health insurance as employee benefits. These big policies tended to be offered by companies large enough to afford them—and to provide a sizable pool of insured workers. As a result, the power of the major insurers swelled, starving out the little guys, along with most of the fly-by-night operators. In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled that the insurance industry should be federally regulated. However, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945, returning oversight to the state level. Regulatory control remains mainly at the state level to this day. Meanwhile, the large insurance companies continue to grow in size, particularly as they merge with one another and with other giants in the financial industry. Now many of these companies offer a range of financial services that go well beyond insurance. Modern Landscape of U.S. Insurance The most profound change in the U.S. insurance industry in recent years has been propelled by the growth of the internet. Insurance buyers increasingly go online to shop for coverage and insurers have changed many of their sales and underwriting practices as a result. The worldwide reach of the internet has also led to further mergers among financial services firms as they compete in what is increasingly a global marketplace. The Bottom Line The roots of American insurance trace back to Benjamin Franklin's founding of the Philadelphia Contributionship in 1752, marking the country's earliest property insurance efforts. As new risks emerged throughout U.S. history, including those from cars and aviation, the insurance industry responded with specialized coverage. Scandals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries prompted regulatory shifts, with insurance oversight moving primarily to the state level
