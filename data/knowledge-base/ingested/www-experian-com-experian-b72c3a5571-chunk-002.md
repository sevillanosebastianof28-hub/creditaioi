Changes Your Account Terms Steps to Take When Credit Card APRs Decrease Lower credit card APRs offer an opportunity to improve your finances. Here are some steps you can take if your rate drops.

If you have balances on multiple credit cards, focusing on the card with the highest interest rate will offer the most savings. - Shop for a new credit card. Since your credit card rate is assigned based on your creditworthiness at the time you applied, you may qualify for a lower interest rate, especially if you've improved your credit. Shopping for a new card could mean you find a lower interest rate and even some new perks. - Ask for a lower interest rate. Alternatively, you can contact your current card issuers to request a lower interest rate. With an improved credit score and a pattern of making on-time payments, you may be more likely to receive a lower rate. - Reassess your budget. Adjust your budget to reflect changes to your credit card payments if, for instance, you're making lower payments or you've paid off a balance due to lower rates. This gives you an opportunity to see how much flexibility you have in your budget now that you're spending less on credit card payments. - Save for emergencies.

With money in savings, you're less likely to rely on credit cards the next time you face an unexpected expense. - Learn more: Reasons to Pay More Than the Minimum on Your Credit Card Save with 0% intro APR credit cards Ways to Pay Off Your Credit Card Debt Faster If you're committed to paying off your credit card debt, here are some strategies to pay off your debt quickly.

Debt Avalanche Method The debt avalanche method is similar to the debt snowball approach, except that you focus on the highest interest rate balance first rather than the lowest balance.
