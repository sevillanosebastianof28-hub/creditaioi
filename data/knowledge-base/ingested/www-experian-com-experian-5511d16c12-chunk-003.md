will likely be required to have full coverage with a lease. - So is there ever a time to consider buying liability only instead of full coverage? Yes. It's a judgment call, but you may want to purchase liability in the following scenarios. You're on a very tight budget. If you simply feel that you can't afford to pay for full coverage, and you own your car outright or the lender is no longer requiring full coverage, you may decide that liability insurance is more practical. - You have an old car. Depending on the age and condition of your vehicle, the cost of full coverage might quickly eclipse its value. But having an older vehicle shouldn't make you automatically get rid of full coverageâolder cars sometimes hold their value. You also may want your insurance to fix your old car if it gets banged up. - You have a healthy savings account. You may feel like it would not be a huge imposition to be in a wreck and lose your car. If you have plenty of money saved in your emergency fund for repairs or a new car, you might feel comfortable buying only liability coverage. Then again, you might consider doing what you can to avoid having to empty your emergency fundâincluding by having full coverage on your vehicle. - Learn more: How to Choose a Car Insurance Company What Should Be Driving Your Decision?
