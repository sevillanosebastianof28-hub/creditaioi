How to Repair Your Credit in 11 Steps Quick Answer Here are 11 ways to repair your credit, including reducing your credit utilization and monitoring your credit report, to boost your credit score for free. Good credit can make it easier to do anything from rent an apartment to qualify for a lower rate on a car loan. On the other hand, bad credit can be an obstacle to achieving your goals. When your credit history is a barrier to the financial life you want, companies promising credit repair may seem like saviors. But when it comes to credit repair, taking matters into your own hands can save you thousands of dollars. Credit repair companies often charge hefty fees to find and dispute negative information on your credit reports. The good news is you don't have to pay anybody to fix your credit. You can repair your credit for free by checking your credit report and taking measures to improve your credit score. Read on for 11 steps you can take to start repairing your credit now. 1. Check Your Credit Report Inaccuracies in credit reports are rare but may show up from time to time, and depending on the information involved, could negatively affect your credit score. Reviewing your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) at least once a year helps you spot problems. You can get copies of your credit reports free from AnnualCreditReport.com. Review your credit report for the following: Accounts: Open credit accounts and accounts closed for up to 10 years appear on your credit report. Look for accounts you don't recognize, payments inaccurately reported as late and other potential errors. - Personal information: This includes your name and any variations, birth date, and current and past addresses and employers. - Credit inquiries: Inquiries occur when a company or individual accesses your credit report. Hard inquiries occur when you apply for credit; a hard inquiry you don't recognize could indicate fraud. - Learn more: What to Look for When You Review Your Credit Report 2. Dispute Credit Report Errors Inaccurate negative information, even if it's just a late payment that was actually paid on time, could lower your credit score. Errors in personal information, such a name or address reported incorrectly by a creditor, won't affect your credit score but should still be corrected. If your credit report contains something you believe is inaccurate, you have the right to file a dispute with the relevant credit bureau. You can dispute errors in your Experian credit report online, by mail or by phone; TransUnion and Equifax have their own dispute processes. Once you file a dispute, Experian asks the company that provided the disputed information to check their records. Incorrect information will be corrected; information that can't be verified will be deleted or updated. 3. Bring Past-Due Accounts Current Payments 30 days or more past due can be reported to credit bureaus as late. Because payment history is the biggest factor in your credit score, even one late payment can lower your score. Late payments stay on your credit report for up to seven years. If you're late but not yet 30 days behind on a payment, pay it immediately. If the payment is already 30 or more days overdue, bring the account current as soon as possible. A payment that's 60, 90 or 120 days late will hurt your credit score more than one that's 30 days late. Can't afford to make the payment? Contact the lender to ask about hardship options. 4. Set Up Autopay Payment history accounts for 35% of your FICOÂ® ScoreÎ, so once your accounts are all current, keep them that way by setting up autopay. You can generally set up autopay directly with the lender or service provider or through the bank account
