A Justice may speak, write, lecture, teach, and participate in other activities concerning the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice subject to the following limitations and considerations: (a) A Justice should not speak at an event sponsored by or associated with a political party or a campaign for political office. (b) A Justice should not speak at or otherwise participate in an event that promotes a commercial product or service, except that a Justice may attend and speak at an event where the Justice’s books are available for purchase. (c) A Justice should not speak to or participate in a meeting organized by a group if the Justice knows that the group has a substantial financial interest in the outcome of a case that is before the Court or is likely to come before the Court in the near future. (d) A Justice may attend a “fundraising event” of law-related or other nonprofit organizations, but a Justice should not knowingly be a speaker, a guest of honor, or featured on the program of such event. In general, an event is a “fundraising event” if proceeds from the event exceed its costs or if donations are solicited in connection with the event. (e) In deciding whether to speak or appear before any group, a Justice should consider whether doing so would create an appearance of impropriety in the minds of reasonable members of the public. Except in unusual circumstances, no such appearance will be created when a Justice speaks to a group of students or any other group associated with an educational institution, a bar group, a religious group, or a non-partisan scholarly or cultural group. (2) Consultation. A Justice may consult with or appear at a public hearing before an executive or legislative body or official: (a) on matters concerning the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice; (b) to the extent it would generally be perceived that a Justice’s judicial experience provides special expertise in the area; or (c) when the Justice is acting pro se in a matter involving the Justice or the Justice’s interest. (3) Organizations. A Justice may participate in and serve as a member, officer, director, trustee, or nonlegal advisor of a nonprofit organization devoted to the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice and may assist such an organization in the management and investment of funds. A Justice may make recommendations to public and private fund-granting agencies about projects and programs concerning the law, the legal system, and the administration of justice. (4) Arbitration and Mediation. A Justice should not act as an arbitrator or mediator or otherwise perform judicial functions apart from the Justice’s official duties unless authorized by law. (5) Practice of Law. A Justice should not practice law and should not serve as a family member’s lawyer in any forum. A Justice may, however, act pro se and may, without compensation, give legal advice to and draft or review documents for a member of the Justice’s family. B. Civic and Charitable Activities. A Justice may participate in and serve as an officer, director, trustee, or nonlegal advisor of a nonprofit civic, charitable, educational, religious, or social organization, subject to the following limitations: (1) A Justice should not serve if it is likely that the organization will either be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the Justice or be regularly engaged in adversary proceedings in any court. (2) A Justice should not give investment advice to such an organization but may serve on its board of directors or trustees even though it has the responsibility for approving investment decisions. C. FUNDRAISING. A Justice may assist nonprofit law-related, civic, charitable, educational, religious, or social organizations
