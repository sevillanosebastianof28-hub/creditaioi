We have federal rule-making authority to issue industry-wide regulations (Rules and Guides) to deal with common unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires websites and online services to get consent from parents to collect personal data from kids under 13. Another example is the Contact Lens Rule, which requires prescribers to give customers a copy of their prescription. Commission rules -- including the Commission rules of organization, procedure, and practice -- are published in Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
