How Do Fed Interest Rate Cuts Impact Credit Cards? Quick Answer When the Fed reduces interest rates, credit card issuers also lower rates on cards with variable APRs. Exact timing varies, but many card issuers will update the APR within a month or two. When the Federal Reserve lowers the federal funds rate, credit card issuers typically follow suit. With two Fed rate cuts so far in 2025 and more expected in 2026, that means reduced rates on your credit cards could be just around the corner. Consumers in the United States collectively have over $1 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, according to Experian data, and lower credit card rates may bring much-needed financial relief to many credit card holders. To help you decide the best approach to your finances, let's explore how the federal funds rate influences credit cards and steps you can take if your interest rate decreases. How the Fed Sets Interest Rates The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge when they lend money to each other overnight, is set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a committee within the Federal Reserve. The FOMC meets several times a year to decide whether to raise, lower or maintain the federal funds rate. These decisions are based on economic conditions. When inflation is running high, for example, the FOMC may raise the federal funds rate to make borrowing more expensive, which helps slow spending and bring prices back under control. Banks consider the federal funds rate when deciding the prime rate, which is charged to their most creditworthy customers. The prime rate is usually 3% higher than the federal funds rate. For example, if the federal funds target rate is 4% to 4.25%, the prime rate would be 7.25%. How Fed Rate Cuts Affect Credit Card APRs When the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, borrowing typically becomes cheaper across the economy, including on credit cards. But the effect depends on the type of credit card you have and how your annual percentage rate (APR) is structured. Variable-Rate Credit Cards Most credit cards have variable interest rates tied to the prime rate, which moves up or down along with the Fed's benchmark rate. When the Fed lowers rates, your card's APR will usually follow suit. That said, issuers aren't required to match rate cuts immediately or by the same amount. Fixed-Rate Credit Cards Fixed-rate credit cards are rare, and they don't automatically get cheaper when the Fed cuts interest rates. Since their APRs aren't tied to the prime rate, your interest rate will stay the same unless your card issuer decides to lower it voluntarily. How Soon Do Credit Card Rates Change? If the prime rate drops after a Fed rate cut, your credit card's variable APR may decrease as well. Most issuers adjust rates shortly after the prime rate changesâtypically within one or two billing cyclesâbut the exact timing can vary by lender. Review your cardholder agreement to see how your issuer links your APR to the prime rate and how quickly changes take effect.
