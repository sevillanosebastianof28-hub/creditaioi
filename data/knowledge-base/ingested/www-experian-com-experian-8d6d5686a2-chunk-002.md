lawsuit, eventually leading to garnished wages or a lien against your property. Learn more: How Can I Find All My Debt? 5. Consider a Credit-Builder Loan If you're focused on building credit from scratch or recovering after a hit to your score, a credit-builder loan from a credit union could help. You'll make fixed payments for six to 24 months, and your money will sit in a savings account you'll be able to access at the end of the loan term. In the meantime, the lender will report your on-time payments to the credit bureaus, which could strengthen your score. Just make sure the lender reports to all three credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) for the best credit-building opportunity. Compare personal loan rates Find APRs from 4.99% to 35.99% and flexible terms of 12 to 120 months. Loan amounts range from $1,000 up to $250,000, with funding available the same day or up to 7 days.

Seek Out a Secured Credit Card Another option for building credit is to get a secured credit card. This type of credit card requires a cash deposit, typically around $200, which becomes your credit limit. Depending on cardholder policies, you may be able to provide a larger deposit for a higher credit line or be upgraded to a higher limit once you've made a certain number of on-time payments. You can use a secured credit card as you would any other, and the deposit protects the issuer from the possibility that you won't pay off your balance. After you've established a history of using your secured card responsibly, your card issuer may upgrade you to an unsecured card down the line. Learn more: How to Get a Secured Credit Card 7. Join an Account as an Authorized User You can also improve credit by joining a trusted family member's or friend's credit card account as an authorized user. You'll be able to use the card to make purchases, and the card's payment history will show up on your credit report. That makes it crucial to pick someone whose credit habits you will benefit from. Work with the primary cardholder to pay them for your purchases, as they'll be ultimately responsible for any balance on the card. 8. Dispute Credit Report Inaccuracies You can get a free credit report from each of the three main credit bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com. Check them each carefully. You have a right to file a dispute if you find something on your report you believe shouldn't be there, such as an incorrectly reported late payment. You can also report the problem to the appropriate creditor, which may then update the information with the bureaus. Fixing any issues could give your credit scores a lift. 9. Get Credit for Monthly Bill Payments Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸ lets you add eligible rent, phone, utility, insurance and streaming payments to your credit report. That, in turn, may cause your FICOÂ® Score to rise. For a bill to be eligible, you'll need to have at least three payments in the past six months (including one payment within the past three months). Experian Boost is free, but it will only affect your Experian credit report and scores. Those who are eligible could see an instant increase to their FICOÂ® Score. 10. Keep Old Accounts Open Even if you no longer use an old credit card, it's typically best to keep the account open. That's because your credit scores benefit from a long credit history and a high total credit limit. Closing established accounts will shorten the average age of your accounts and lower your total credit limit. It will take years before an account closed in
