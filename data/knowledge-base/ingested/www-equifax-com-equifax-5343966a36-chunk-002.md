A fraud alert is a notice that is placed on your credit report that alerts credit card companies and others who may extend you credit that you may have been a victim of fraud, including identity theft. Think of it as a “red flag” that encourages companies to take steps to verify your identity before extending credit in your name. You may contact any of the three nationwide credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — to request a fraud alert. Once you place an alert with one of the bureaus, that bureau will send your request to the other two bureaus. Fraud alerts are free, and there are two types: An initial fraud alert can be placed if you believe you are or may become a victim of fraud or identity theft. It lasts for one year and can be renewed. When you or someone else attempts to open an account in your name or make changes on an existing account, such as increasing the credit limit, the company must take reasonable steps to confirm you are who you say you are, such as contacting you by phone at a number you provide, before completing the request. - An extended fraud alert can be placed if you are a victim of fraud or identity theft. It requires a copy of a valid police or law enforcement agency report, or a Federal Trade Commission Identity Theft Report, and lasts for 7 years. With an extended fraud alert, a lender or creditor is required to verify your identity in person or by phone at a number you provide before opening new accounts or making changes to existing accounts. - If you are on active military duty and want to help minimize your risk of fraud or identity theft while you are deployed, an active duty alert is available to you. The active duty alert is similar to an initial fraud alert: it also lasts a year, and companies must take reasonable steps to verify your identity before opening new accounts in your name or modifying existing ones.
