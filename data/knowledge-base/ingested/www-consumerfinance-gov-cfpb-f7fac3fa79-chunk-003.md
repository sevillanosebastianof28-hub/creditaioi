decline to block or rescind a block if you make a material misrepresentation of fact about being a victim of identity theft or if you got goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction. Within four business days after receiving your request, the credit reporting company must block that information from your credit report. In addition, they must tell the companies that provided the information that someone stole your identity. Once notified, creditors can’t turn identity theft-related debts over to debt collectors. If you need to dispute a debt that is not the result of identity theft, read “How do I dispute an error on my credit report?” If you have a problem with credit reporting, you can submit a complaint to the CFPB.
