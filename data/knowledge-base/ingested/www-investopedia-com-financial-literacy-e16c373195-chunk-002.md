relieve some of these potential burdens. Successful businesses are prepared for the unexpected, and that's where professional liability insurance comes in. Understanding Coverage Options in Professional Liability Insurance The policy will specifically lay out what and who is covered. The policy will likely cover breach of fiduciary duty, lack of regulatory compliance, and legal coverage. In general, E&O insurance is structured to cover the professional when the advisor makes a mistake or is accused of malfeasance. Whether the advisor is legally responsible or not, the insurance will offset the cost of responding to legal claims. If you forget to inform a client of the time frame for a 401(k) rollover when they switch jobs, you may be at fault or liable for their penalties, fees, and/or taxes. The E&O policy will serve you well in this type of situation. You may wonder what would happen if the front-end worker, or a consultant working on behalf of the firm, makes a mistake. Comb through the insurance policy and understand who is covered. Sometimes, W-2 employees are covered, but not independent contractors. Knowing these small differences in the policy can translate into big bucks when a claim is made. What’s Not Covered in Professional Liability Insurance for Advisors Understand your policy. Is discretionary advice excluded? This is a surprise exclusion for many insurance brokers as it is specific to the financial advisory business. Another potential exclusion may come up if your company is paying bills on behalf of the client. A client asked her advisor to handle the bills to the nursing home for her husband’s care. Several years later, she discovers that your company significantly overpaid the nursing home, and she’s not able to recoup the overpayment. Your liability policy may not cover those bill-paying services because they fall under the exclusion for discretionary advice. Review all of the aspects of the professional liability insurance policy with the insurance broker and know what is and isn’t covered. A consent to settle is another clause that the advisor needs to understand. That way, the planner avoids surprises when you are compelled to settle a claim instead of fighting it. Make sure the company policies are aligned with the insurance coverage. The Bottom Line As with any type of insurance, consult with a trusted insurance agent to find the best policy for your needs. Buy the policy from an agent who's familiar with the financial advisory business. Make certain you know the coverages and exclusions in the policy. Include coverage for employees as well and learn about how to file a claim in advance so you're ready to proceed in the heat of legal action.
