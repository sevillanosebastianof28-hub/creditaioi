When to Consider a Prepaid Card A prepaid card may be the best choice for you if you simply want an alternate method of payment, are trying to allocate a set amount of funds toward budgeting or are giving the prepaid card to someone else, such as for a child's allowance. You won't risk going into debt or incurring any interest charges, but you'll still need to be mindful of fees and read the card's terms. Know Your Score First Both secured credit cards and prepaid cards have their perks, but which one you should pick comes down to your needs. While they can both be used to make purchases, they're otherwise different and best fit to different goals. Know the strengths and weaknesses of both before you proceed with either. Keep in mind that you aren't necessarily limited to these two options. To see where you stand, first check your credit score for free through Experian.
