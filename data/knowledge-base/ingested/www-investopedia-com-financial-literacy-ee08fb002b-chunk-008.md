With life insurance, policyholders designate who they want to receive the death benefit, known as the beneficiaries. The death benefit is typically received tax-free. The premiums—or the cost you pay for a life insurance policy—are influenced by many factors such as the type of insurance you purchase, your gender, age, health status, and medical history. Someone who is 30 years old with no pre-existing conditions will qualify for lower premiums compared to someone who’s in their 60s, smokes, and has diabetes. Life Insurance Benefits There are a variety of reasons why you might take out a life insurance policy. For example, some policyholders might want to leave behind a financial legacy, while others may want to provide their family with an income replacement while they’re gone. Additionally, some life insurance policies offer living benefit riders, which can pay out while you’re still alive. For instance, some living benefit riders enable people to access all or a part of their death benefit if they’re diagnosed with a chronic or terminal illness. Some of these riders are included automatically, while others cost extra, depending on the insurer and type of benefit. Finally, some life insurance policies build cash value, which you can access and spend while alive. These policies combine a savings account with life insurance protection. Life Insurance Underwriting You are not guaranteed to buy most types of life insurance. When someone applies for a policy, the insurer will complete a process known as underwriting to assess the risk of an applicant. They’ll then use the information to determine whether someone is eligible for a policy, the cost of premiums, and the amount of coverage. During the underwriting process, an insurer will require that you complete an application and undergo a medical exam where blood and urine samples are taken. They may also evaluate data like your prescription history, driving records, credit history, and more. However, there are some types of life insurance policies that don’t require applicants to undergo the full underwriting process, but these policies may offer lower coverage amounts and charge higher premiums. Types of Life Insurance Policies There are broadly two types of life insurance: term life and permanent life. Term life insurance offers temporary coverage (and is typically much more affordable because of this) while permanent life provides lifetime coverage so long as you keep paying the premiums. Term Life Insurance Term life insurance is a type of life insurance that offers policyholders coverage for a fixed period of time—typically, between 10 and 30 years. If a policyholder dies while they’re covered, their beneficiaries will receive the death benefit. But if an individual outlives their policy, allowing the policy to expire without renewing it, their beneficiaries won’t receive the death benefit. These policies usually have fixed premiums during the term, and tend to be much more affordable than permanent life insurance policies. That’s because most term life insurance policyholders outlive their coverage, so insurance companies take on less risk when insuring these policies. You and your beneficiaries are also much less likely to receive a payout from term life insurance. If you want more flexibility with your term life insurance policy, you may consider opting for a convertible term life insurance policy. These policies give people the option of converting their term life policies into permanent whole life policies without undergoing an additional medical exam. Whole Life Insurance Whole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that offers lifelong coverage. This means that as long as a policyholder keeps up with their premiums, their beneficiaries are guaranteed to receive a death benefit when they pass away. Whole life insurance is typically much more expensive than term life. Like other permanent life insurance policies, whole life insurance offers a savings feature known as cash value, which policyholders can borrow from, withdraw, and use to pay
