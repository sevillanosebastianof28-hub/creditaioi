9 Things You May Not Know About the Fair Credit Reporting Act - But Should Highlights: The Fair Credit Reporting Act limits who can access your credit report and for what purpose - Potential employers must get your written permission before accessing your credit reports - Credit bureaus must remove your name from marketing lists if you ask - When you apply for things like a new credit card, a mortgage or an apartment, the companies you apply with will often request a copy of your credit report from one or more of the three nationwide credit bureaus – Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. The companies use the information in your credit report as one factor in helping them decide whether to approve your application based on their decision-making criteria. All of these companies – the lenders and creditors you apply with and the credit bureaus – must operate under laws protecting consumers and how their credit information can be used. The primary law is the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Among other things, the FCRA limits who can access your credit reports and for what purposes. Here are some of the rights provided to consumers under the FCRA: 1. Credit bureaus must provide your credit report to you when you ask for it. If you ask for a copy of your credit report and verify your identity, a credit bureau must provide it to you. Consumers are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit bureaus. You can get these by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com. You can also create a myEquifax account to get six free Equifax credit reports each year. In addition, you can click "Get my free credit score" on your myEquifax dashboard to enroll in Equifax Core Credit™ for a free monthly Equifax credit report and a free monthly VantageScore® 3.0 credit score, based on Equifax data. A VantageScore is one of many types of credit scores. 2. Credit bureaus must limit access to your credit information. The only people or companies allowed to access your credit report are those with “permissible purpose.” This means they must have one of many very specific reasons to be checking your credit. That might be because you’ve applied for a loan or credit card, for example, or you’re renting an apartment. Who has permissible purpose? Here are some examples: Lenders and creditors you are applying for credit with - Lenders who wish to prequalify you for credit or insurance - Existing creditors you have a relationship with - Debt collection companies to use in collecting payment - Insurance companies, to underwrite insurance involving you - Employers or prospective employers (with your permission) - Rental companies/landlords, phone and utility companies - Certain government agencies - Learn more about permissible purpose and who can access your credit report here. 3. A potential employer must get your written permission before accessing your credit report. You must provide written consent to an employer before the employer can request your credit report from a credit bureau. 4. Credit bureaus must investigate disputed information and correct or delete inaccurate information. If you believe your credit report contains inaccurate or incomplete information and file a dispute with a credit bureau, the bureau must investigate the dispute within a specific period of time. If the investigation finds the disputed information is inaccurate, or if the information can’t be verified, the bureau must correct that information or delete it from your credit report. If an investigation fails to resolve your dispute, you can ask the credit bureau to add a statement to your credit report explaining the matter.
