enforcement agency report, or a Federal Trade Commission Identity Theft Report, and lasts for 7 years. With an extended fraud alert, a lender or creditor is required to verify your identity in person or by phone at a number you provide before opening new accounts or making changes to existing accounts. - If you are on active military duty and want to help minimize your risk of fraud or identity theft while you are deployed, an active duty alert is available to you. The active duty alert is similar to an initial fraud alert: it also lasts a year, and companies must take reasonable steps to verify your identity before opening new accounts in your name or modifying existing ones. A credit report lock and a security freeze both generally prevent access to your Equifax credit report to open new credit accounts. Unless you temporarily lift or permanently remove a freeze, or unlock your credit report, it can’t be accessed to open new accounts (subject to certain exceptions). Because these functions have the same impact, you cannot add both a freeze and a lock to your Equifax credit report. See more about exceptions below. Security freezes (also known as credit freezes) are federally regulated and allow you to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a freeze. At Equifax, you can manage your freeze online with your username and password after creating a myEquifax account. You can also manage your freeze by phone: Call us at (888) 298-0045. You’ll be required to give certain information to verify your identity. You’ll also have the option to receive a one-time PIN by text message or answer questions based on information in your Equifax credit report for identity verification. Placing, lifting and removing a security freeze is free. - Credit report locks are mobile app-enabled and allow you to lock and unlock your Equifax credit report using identity verification techniques such as usernames and passwords. - Placing a security freeze on your Equifax credit report will prevent access to it by certain third parties. Freezing your Equifax credit report will not prevent access to your credit report at any other credit reporting agency. Exceptions: Locking or freezing your Equifax credit report will prevent access to it by certain third parties. Locking or freezing your Equifax credit report will not prevent access to your credit report at any other credit bureau. Entities that may still have access to your Equifax credit report include: Companies like Equifax Consumer Services LLC, which provide you with access to your credit score or report, or monitor your credit report as part of a subscription or similar service; - Companies that provide you with a copy of your credit score or report, upon your request; - Federal, state, and local government agencies and courts in certain circumstances; - Companies using the information in connection with the underwriting of insurance, or for employment, tenant or background screening purposes; - Companies that have a current account or relationship with you, and collection agencies acting on behalf of those whom you owe; - Companies that authenticate a consumer’s identity for purposes other than granting credit, or for investigating or preventing actual or potential fraud; and - Companies that wish to make pre-approved offers of credit or insurance to you. To opt out of such pre-approved offers, visit www.optoutprescreen.com. - Equifax maintains consumers’ credit reports and provides information to certain customers, including credit card companies and lenders, so that they may offer pre-approved offers to consumers as permitted by law. Consumers that prefer not to receive such offers should visit www.optoutprescreen.com, or call toll free at 1-888-5-OPT OUT (or 1-888-567-8688).
