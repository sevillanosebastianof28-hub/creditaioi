Understanding credit begins with understanding your credit reports. Credit reports are a summary of your credit history, reported to nationwide credit reporting agencies. They contain: -The main factors typically involved in calculating a credit score are: -The number of accounts you have -The types of accounts you have -Your used revolving credit vs. your available revolving credit -The length of your credit history -Your payment history If you look at your credit scores based on data from each of the three nationwide credit bureaus – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – you may see three different scores. This is completely normal. Your scores may not all be the same because not all creditors and lenders report to all three bureaus. Many creditors report to all three, but you may have an account with a creditor that only reports to one, two, or none. There are many different credit scoring companies and credit scoring models, or differing methods of calculating credit scores. Credit scores are calculated based on the information in your credit reports. Two of the biggest companies when it comes to credit scoring models are FICO and VantageScore. VantageScore is the result of a collaboration between the three nationwide credit bureaus – Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. 5 Things That May Hurt Your Credit Scores Reading time: 4 minutes Continue Reading There are many different scoring models used to determine a credit score. Here is a general breakdown of the factors used to calculate your VantageScore® 3.0 credit score: Payment history: 35% - Your credit history includes information about how you have repaid the credit you have already been extended. It includes the number and type of credit accounts that you paid on time, details on late or missed payments, and how many of your credit accounts are delinquent in relation to all of your accounts on file. It also includes details on public record and collection items, including bankruptcies, foreclosures, wage garnishments, and any delinquencies that were reported to collection agencies. Used credit vs. available credit: 30% - Your credit score reflects an analysis of how much of your total credit amount is being used, and how much you currently owe. Type of credit used: 15% - Your credit score reflects the different types of credit accounts you have, including revolving debt (such as credit cards) and installment loans (such as mortgages, home equity loans, auto loans, student loans, and personal loans). Lenders and creditors look at how many of each type of account you have, to determine if you may be able to manage multiple accounts of different types. New credit: 10-12% - Your credit score reflects how many new credit accounts you’ve opened compared with the total number of accounts in your credit report. It takes into account how many recent requests for credit you initiated, as indicated by inquiries by creditors to credit reporting companies. Your credit score does not take into account requests a creditor has made for your credit report in order to make a preapproved credit offer, or to review your account you already have with them, nor does it take into account your own request for a copy of your credit history. Your credit score will factor in the length of time since creditors made credit report inquiries. Length of credit history: 5-7% - This section details how long you’ve had your credit accounts. The credit score calculation includes both how long your oldest and most recent accounts have been open. In general, creditors like to see that you’ve been able to properly handle credit accounts over a period of time. What are the benefits of knowing your VantageScore 3.0 credit score?
