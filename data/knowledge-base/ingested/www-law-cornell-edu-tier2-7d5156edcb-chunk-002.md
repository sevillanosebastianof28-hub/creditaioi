as the "Short Title". How the LII Table of Popular Names works. Our Table of Popular Names is organized alphabetically by popular name. You'll find three types of link associated with each popular name (though each law may not have all three types). One, a reference to a Public Law number, is a link to the bill as it was originally passed by Congress, and will take you to the LRC THOMAS legislative system, or GPO FDSYS site. So-called "Short Title" links, and links to particular sections of the Code, will lead you to a textual roadmap (the section notes) describing how the particular law was incorporated into the Code. Finally, acts may be referred to by a different name, or may have been renamed, the links will take you to the appropriate listing in the table. 1921 Silver Dollar Coin Anniversary Act 1921 Silver Dollar Coin Anniversary Act 116-286, , 2021-01-05, 134 Stat. 4879 1950 Amendment to Public Law 38 1950 Amendment to Public Law 38 1950-08-05, ch. 592, , 64 Stat. 414 1951 Amendments to the Universal Military Training and Service Act 1951 Amendments to the Universal Military Training and Service Act 1951-06-19, ch. 144, title I, 65 Stat. 75 1955 Amendments to the Universal Military Training and Service Act 1955 Amendments to the Universal Military Training and Service Act 1955-06-30, ch. 250, , 69 Stat. 223 1959 Amendment to the Texas City Disaster Relief Act 1959 Amendment to the Texas City Disaster Relief Act 86-381, , 1959-09-25, 73 Stat. 706 1964 Amendments to the Alaska Omnibus Act 1964 Amendments to the Alaska Omnibus Act 88-451, , 1964-08-19, 78 Stat. 505 1979 White House Conference on the Arts Act 1979 White House Conference on the Arts Act 95-272, title I, 1978-05-03, 92 Stat. 222 1979 White House Conference on the Humanities Act 1979 White House Conference on the Humanities Act 95-272, title II, 1978-05-03, 92 Stat. 224 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism 98-533, , 1984-10-19, 98 Stat. 2706 (18 U.S.C. 3071 note) 1988 Olympic Commemorative Coin Act 1988 Olympic Commemorative Coin Act 100-141, , 1987-10-28, 101 Stat. 832 1992 National Assessment of Chapter 1 Act 1992 National Assessment of Chapter 1 Act 101-305, , 1990-05-30, 104 Stat. 253 1992 Olympic Commemorative Coin Act 1992 Olympic Commemorative Coin Act 101-406, , 1990-10-03, 104 Stat. 879 1992 White House Commemorative Coin Act 1992 White House Commemorative Coin Act 102-281, title I, 1992-05-13, 106 Stat. 133 1993 White House Conference on Children, Youth, and Families 1993 White House Conference on Children, Youth, and Families 101-501, title IX, subtitle B (Sec. 981 et seq.), 1990-11-03, 104 Stat. 1280 (42 U.S.C. 12301 note) 1997 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from Natural Disasters, and for Overseas Peacekeeping Efforts, Including Those in Bosnia 1997 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from Natural Disasters, and for Overseas Peacekeeping Efforts, Including Those in Bosnia 105-18, , 1997-06-12, 111 Stat. 158 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act 105-174, , 1998-05-01, 112 Stat. 58 1999 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act 1999 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act 106-31, , 1999-05-21, 113 Stat. 57 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States 107-38, , 2001-09-18, 115 Stat. 220 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery From and Response To Terrorist Attacks on the United States 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery From and Response To Terrorist Attacks on the United States 107-206, , 2002-08-02, 116 Stat. 820 2002 Winter Olympic Commemorative Coin Act 2002 Winter Olympic Commemorative Coin Act 106-435, , 2000-11-06, 114 Stat. 1916 2004 District of Columbia Omnibus Authorization Act 2004 District of Columbia Omnibus Authorization Act 108-386, , 2004-10-30,
