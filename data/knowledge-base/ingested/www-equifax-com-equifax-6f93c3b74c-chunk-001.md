Buying a home is one of the most exciting and stressful milestones we face, and as one of the largest financial commitments you’ll make, it’s important to be prepared with the right information to understand what you can afford, up front and ongoing. Here are a few first steps you should take in the process: Your credit report tells a detailed story about you, your financial accounts and your payment history. This information is important to potential lenders and creditors and can help them decide to accept or deny your application, and what interest rate to charge you if accepted. They tend to look at: Payment history: Are you paying your credit accounts as agreed, or do you have missed or late payments? Do you have accounts in collection? While a few missed payments may not result in a denial, they can result in less favorable loan terms. - Debt to credit ratio: Using a large percentage of your available credit can be a red flag to potential lenders. - Length of credit history: Do you have a long track record of responsible credit use? - Types of credit: Lenders generally like to see a good mix of different credit types, showing that you have a history of managing multiple sources of credit reliably. - New accounts: Have you opened or tried to open a large number of new credit accounts recently? If so, lenders may question your ability to repay. - Potential lenders for a purchase or lease loan look at the same criteria on your credit report. But even renting a car can affect or be affected by your credit. When you rent a car you're usually required to use a credit or debit card. If you use a debit card, car rental companies may pull your credit report to determine the risk of renting to you. When a company pulls your credit report it may impact your credit scores. For that reason, you may want to consider using a credit card instead. To view your Equifax credit report just sign into a free Equifax Core Credit™ account and click “View your credit report” under the Equifax Credit Report Summary card on your dashboard. You can also get your free annual credit report from each of the three nationwide agencies (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) through annualcreditreport.com. Understand the role your credit plays in the home buying process Before even starting your search for a home it’s best to check your credit to see what it shows, and to see if there’s anything you didn’t expect on it, so you have time to clear it up before your search begins in earnest. Check your credit for free Check your Equifax credit report monthly for free with Equifax Core Credit™ to help you better understand your current credit position. Checking your own credit scores and reports will not impact your credit scores. Figure out how much home you can afford Create a monthly budget and review your available finances for a down payment. That will help give you a starting point, but remember a home’s purchase price is only part of the picture; you may also be responsible for a down payment, closing costs, taxes, insurance and other expenses. Online mortgage calculators may help you find a starting range. Gather your documents Realtors, not just potential lenders, will want to make sure they show you homes in your budget, and with their experience, they know where some of the gaps may be. Be prepared for questions with any required documents, such as tax returns, pay stubs, and bank statements, which you’ll also need to prequalify and apply for a mortgage. One important thing you can do as soon as you start thinking about buying a home is checking your credit report. Ideally, this should be done at least six months before
