What Is an APR and How Does It Work? Quick Answer The annual percentage rate, or APR, represents the total annual cost of borrowing money with a credit card or installment loan. Your APR is determined based on your creditworthiness, among other factors. Annual percentage rate (APR) is a number that represents the total cost of borrowing money from a lender. As you shop around for financing, it's important to understand how to calculate APRs and compare them between lenders and card issuers. Here's what you need to know about how APRs work, how they're calculated and what you can do to minimize your borrowing costs. What Is an Annual Percentage Rate (APR)? A loan's APR is its interest rate plus any additional fees the lender charges, such as an upfront origination fee and other finance charges, represented as an annualized rate. Combining eligible fees and interest costs into one rate can give you a better idea of the annual cost of your loan. When a lender includes fees in its APR calculation, it'll be higher than the loan's interest rate. However, in cases where there are no additional feesâor there are fees that aren't included in the APR, such as a credit card annual feeâthe interest rate and APR are the same. Depending on the type of loan you have, you may have a fixed or a variable APR. Here's how they differ: Fixed APR: As its name suggests, a fixed APR remains the same for the life of the loan, providing predictable monthly payments. - Variable APR: With a variable APR, your rate is partially based on a market benchmark, such as the prime rate. As a result, your APR can fluctuate over time according to various economic conditions. - Types of APRs With an installment loan, you may get either a fixed or variable APR. When you open a credit card, however, there are several other types of APRs that could apply to you depending on how you use your card. Here's how each type works: Purchase APR: This is the rate that applies to purchases you make with a credit card. - Balance transfer APR: If you transfer a balance from one credit card to another, you'll pay the balance transfer APR on that portion of your balance. That said, it's usually the same as the purchase APR. - Promotional or introductory APR: Some credit cards offer an introductory low or 0% APR on purchases or balance transfers for a number of months to incentivize you to open an account. - Cash advance APR: When you use your credit card to withdraw cash from an ATM, the cash advance APR will apply to the amount you withdraw. A cash advance APR is typically higher than the purchase APR, and there's no grace period for interest charges. - Penalty APR: Many credit card agreements include a higher penalty APR that the company will charge if you fall behind on payments by 60 days or more. The higher rate will remain in place for a minimum of six months. - APR vs. APY Annual percentage yield (APY) is another term that sounds similar to APR, but the two are very different. More specifically, the term APY is an annualized percentage that represents how much interest you'll earn, or yield, on a deposit account, such as a high-yield savings account, certificate of deposit or interest-bearing checking account. Rather than incorporating fees associated with the deposit account, the APY accounts for compound interest you might earn. APR vs. APY Example Let's say you take out a personal loan of $15,000 with a 10% interest rate, a 5% origination fee and a three-year repayment term. Your loan's APR would be 13.39% (your interest charged plus the 5% origination fee, averaged over the life of your loan). Your total costs, including both
