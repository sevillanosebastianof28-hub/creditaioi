How to Check for Identity Theft Quick Answer Here are six simple ways to check for identity theft: Identity theft can create a financial nightmare. It happens when someone uses your personal information to do things without your consentâlike access your money, open credit accounts or file a tax return in your name. In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission received over 1 million reports of this type of fraud. Knowing how to check for identity theft can help you spot potential fraud and take action sooner rather than later. How to Check for Identity Theft Here are some simple ways to check if your identity has been stolen. 1. Review Your Credit Reports It's a good habit to check your credit reports at least once a year. Doing so could help you: Discover identity theft: If you have credit accounts in your name, you should have a credit report with each of the major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax). Each report lists your open accounts, current balances and payment history. Take notice of unfamiliar accounts or debt balances that are higher than expectedâthose could be warning signs of identity theft. You can check your credit report for free with Experian or through AnnualCreditReport.com. - Improve your financial health: The information contained in your credit report determines your credit score, which is an important part of your financial health. When you apply for new credit, lenders will consider your credit score to help them make a decision. Checking your credit report allows you to review your credit file and make a plan for improving your score. - 2. Check Your Bank Statements Reviewing your bank statements is another way to check for identity theft. This involves looking over your transaction history on your debit and credit cards, which can be a regular part of managing your budget. Pay attention to suspicious activity like: Pending or approved transactions you don't recognize - Charges that seem higher than they should be - Unfamiliar ATM withdrawals or bank transfers - It's wise to check your statements at least once a month. If you notice any unauthorized activity, notify your bank immediately. 3. Pay Attention to Strange Mail If someone gets ahold of your personal identifiable information (PII), they could use it to rack up charges in your name. Receiving bills for accounts you don't recognize is a red flag that your identity has been compromised. Unpaid accounts could eventually be sent to third-party agencies that collect debt on behalf of creditors. Debt collectors might also reach out by phone or email. Contact the company that sent the bill to get more information, and check your credit report to see if the account appears there. 4. Stay on Top of Your Tax Returns Tax identity theft happens when someone files a tax return in your name in an attempt to steal your tax refund. If you try to file a legitimate return but can't because one has already been processed, your identity may have been stolen. One way fraudsters do this is by calling consumers and posing as IRS representatives. They might ask for personal information, demand payment for "overdue taxes" or request bank information for your tax refund. 5. Check Your Medical Statements This includes medical bills from providers and explanations of benefits from your health insurance carrier. Be on the lookout for medical services you don't recognize. Medical identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information to receive medical treatment in your name. That can include everything from office visits and lab work to imaging and prescriptions. 6. Review Your Social Security Statements If your personal information gets into the wrong hands, someone could apply for Social Security benefits in your name. They could also use your private data to apply for other government benefits. Warning signs of Social Security fraud
