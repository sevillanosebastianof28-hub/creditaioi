up in a worse situation than before you consolidated your debts. If you tend to overspend, you can reduce the risk of using your cards again by removing them from your wallet and any online sites where you store your card numbers. Reducing access to your cards is usually better than closing your accounts, since that can have a negative effect on your credit scores. Your Credit Could Suffer if You Miss Payments In some instances, consolidating debt can increase your monthly payment instead of lower it. This is particularly true if you're currently paying just the minimum amount due on your credit cards. If your new monthly payment is unaffordable, missing even a single one by 30 days can damage your credit score considerably. Does Debt Consolidation Hurt Your Credit? Debt consolidation can potentially impact your credit score negatively, but in most cases, the effects are temporary in nature. That said, here's what you can expect: Hard inquiry: When you apply for a consolidation loan or balance transfer credit card, most lenders run a hard inquiry on one or more of your credit reports. A single inquiry typically takes fewer than five points off your credit score, but if you apply for multiple types of accounts in a short period, it could have a compounding effect. - Payments: As previously mentioned, paying your bills on time is crucial for building and maintaining a good credit score. If you miss any payments during the consolidation process or after it's completed, your credit score could suffer. - Credit utilization rate: Your credit utilization rate is the percentage of available credit you're using on a credit card. If using a balance transfer credit card to consolidate debt results in a high utilization rate on that card, it could hurt your credit until you pay down the balance. In the long run, however, paying off your debt more quickly should have an overall positive effect. - Mix of accounts: Your credit mix is effectively how diverse your credit accounts are. If you pay off all loans or close credit cards during the consolidation process, it could have a slight negative impact on your credit mix and, therefore, your credit score. - Should I Consolidate Debt? Whether you should get a debt consolidation loan can depend on your mindset, motivation and credit offers. Mindset: If you've already started on your debt-payoff journey and are using debt consolidation as a tool to improve your financial standing, that may be a sign that consolidation will be helpful. But if you consistently struggle with debt due to overspending on discretionary expenses, think long and hard about whether consolidation could backfire rather than help. - Motivation: If you're confident that you can stick to your debt repayment plan, which includes avoiding adding more debt while you work to pay off what you owe, consolidation can be a great fit. However, if you're uncertain about your ability to remain motivated and don't have plans to change your spending habits, consider working on those first. - Credit offers: Even if you know consolidation is a good option, you still need to qualify for a new credit account that will actually help you. With Experian, you can get free access to your credit report and FICOÂ® ScoreÎ to see where you stand. Then, look for preapproved credit offers from lenders and credit card issuers to understand the terms and limits you can qualify for without a hard credit check. - Learn more: Debt Consolidation Mistakes to Avoid Compare personal loan rates Find APRs from 4.99% to 35.99% and flexible terms of 12 to 120 months.
