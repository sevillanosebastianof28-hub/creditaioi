to your desired credit limit to get approved. - Get a credit-builder loan. You may consider a credit-builder loan in addition to or instead of a secured credit card. With this installment loan, the lender will hold the loan proceedsâusually between $300 and $1,000âin a separate account while you make payments, which the lender will report to the credit bureaus. Once you've completed your repayment term, which can range from six to 24 months, you'll receive the loan funds. - Become an authorized user. If you have a loved one who uses their credit card responsibly, consider asking them to add you as an authorized user on the account. Once you have authorized-user status, the account's full history will show up on your credit reports, which can help improve your credit score. Just be sure to confirm that the primary cardholder always pays on time and maintains a low balance relative to their credit limit. Otherwise, being an authorized user may not do much good. - Get a cosigner. If you need a loan to buy a car or finance another large purchase, you may consider asking a loved one with great credit to cosign the loan application. Their creditworthiness can help improve your chances of securing favorable terms, and your on-time payments can contribute to a positive credit history. - Alternatives to Bankruptcy When you're struggling with unmanageable debt, bankruptcy is just one possible solution. Some of the alternatives may also negatively impact your credit, but usually not as drastically as filing for bankruptcy. Here are just a few options to consider. Debt Consolidation If your credit is still in good shape, and you can likely afford to repay your debt with a less demanding repayment plan, research debt consolidation loans and balance transfer credit cards to see if consolidating your debt can make the payments more manageable. With that in mind, consolidation may not work for you if your credit is in fair or poor shape. Debt Management Plan As you do your required credit counseling before filing, talk to the counselor about a debt management plan. With this option, the counselor can work with your creditors to help arrange a workable plan for repaying what you owe, which can include lower interest rates and monthly payments. Debt management plans typically last three to five years and come with modest upfront and monthly fees. However, it only works for unsecured debt like credit cards, medical bills and personal loans. Forbearance or Deferment If your financial challenges are short-term in nature, consider asking some of your creditors about forbearance or deferment. These options typically involve pausing your monthly payments for a short periodâusually just a few monthsâgiving you some time to get back on your financial feet. That said, the process can vary by lender and loan type, so make sure you understand the terms before you agree. Debt Restructuring Depending on the type of loan you have, you may be able to negotiate a restructuring of your debt. Debt restructuring can come in the form of a temporary or permanent adjustment to your loan agreement, or even a settlement for less than what you owe. Before you pursue any of these options, however, do a free consultation with a credit counselor to get expert advice for your situation. The Bottom Line Before you make any decision about bankruptcy or any other form of debt relief, it's important to research your options, get reliable advice from a qualified credit counselor and understand the impact your choices can have on your overall financial well-being. Regardless of what type of debt relief you choose, be proactive about improving your credit score now and in the future to help minimize the negative consequences of certain relief options.
