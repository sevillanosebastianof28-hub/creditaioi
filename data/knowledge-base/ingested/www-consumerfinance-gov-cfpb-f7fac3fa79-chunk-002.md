extended fraud alert on your file, you're entitled to order two free copies of your credit report from each nationwide credit reporting company over a 12- month period. Your name will also be removed for five years from the nationwide credit reporting companies' pre-screen marketing lists for credit offers and insurance. What is an active-duty alert? Servicemembers in the armed forces have an additional option available to them: active-duty alerts, which protect servicemembers while they are on active duty and assigned away from their usual duty station. This alert requires businesses to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before issuing credit in your name. These alerts last for 12 months, unless you request that the alert be removed sooner. If your deployment lasts longer than 12 months, you may place another alert on your credit file. When you place an active-duty alert on your credit report, creditors must take reasonable steps to make sure the person making the request is you before they open an account, issue an additional credit card on an existing account, or increase the credit limit on your existing account. Your name will also be removed for two years from the nationwide credit reporting companies' pre-screen marketing lists for credit offers and insurance. Since it may be very difficult to contact you directly if you are deployed, you can assign a personal representative to answer for you, or to place or remove an active-duty alert. What is a security freeze? Under federal law, you can freeze and unfreeze your credit record for free at the three nationwide credit reporting companies – Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. A security freeze, also called a credit freeze, stops new creditors from accessing your credit file until you lift the freeze. The federal law requiring free security freezes does not apply to someone who requests your credit report for employment, tenant-screening, or insurance purposes. Unlike fraud alerts, if you place a security freeze with one credit reporting company, they will not notify the other credit reporting companies. You must contact each credit reporting company individually if you would like to place a security freeze with all three nationwide credit reporting companies. Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Be mindful that a freeze doesn't prevent identity thieves from taking over existing accounts. How can I block or remove fraudulent information from my consumer report? If you’ve been a victim of identity theft, you can also get credit reporting companies to remove fraudulent information and debts from your credit report, which is called blocking. To do this, you must send the credit reporting companies: An identity theft report, which can be done through IdentityTheft.gov - Proof of your identity - A letter identifying the fraudulent debts and information on your credit report - Through IdentityTheft.gov , you can also get a sample letter to send to the credit reporting companies. Remember that you can use identity theft reports only for debts that are the result of identity theft. Credit reporting companies may decline to block or rescind a block if you make a material misrepresentation of fact about being a victim of identity theft or if you got goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction. Within four business days after receiving your request, the credit reporting company must block that information from your credit report. In addition, they must tell the companies that provided the information that someone stole your identity. Once notified, creditors can’t turn identity theft-related debts over to debt collectors. If you need to dispute a debt that is not the result of identity theft, read “How do I dispute an error on my credit report?” If you have a problem with credit reporting, you
