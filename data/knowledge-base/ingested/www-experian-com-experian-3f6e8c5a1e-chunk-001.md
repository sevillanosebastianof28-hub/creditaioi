What Is a Credit Card Balance? Quick Answer A credit card balance is the amount you owe on your card at a given time. Learn how credit card balances work, how your statement and current balances differ, how balances affect your credit score and smart ways to manage credit card payments. A credit card balance is the total amount of money you owe the credit card company at any given time. This differs from your statement balance, which is the amount you owe at the end of a billing cycle, or your minimum monthly payment, which is the smallest amount you can pay and keep your account in good standing. Learn how your credit card balance works, how it can impact your credit score and the best way to manage your credit card payments. How Do Credit Card Balances Work? When you use your credit card to make a purchase, the purchase amount is added to your credit card balance. At first, these purchases may show up as pending transactions, meaning they're approved but haven't yet posted to your account. Example: Pending transactions don't appear in your statement balance, but they can affect your available credit. For instance, suppose you have a credit card with a $1,000 limit and $500 in pending transactions. If you try to make a $600 purchase, it might be declined because you only have $500 in available credit left. Once transactions are posted, they'll appear in your statement balance. At the end of each month's billing cycle, you'll get a credit card statement showing the balance you owe for that period. This includes any purchases, balance transfers, refunds and payments that were posted to your account during the billing cycle. If your credit card has a grace period, it typically lasts for about 30 days between your statement end date and your payment due date. During the grace period, no interest accrues on the statement balance. If you aren't carrying a balance from the previous billing cycle, you can generally avoid interest by paying the statement balance in full by the due date. You can also pay just part of your statement balance and revolve, or carry over, the rest. The revolving balance starts accruing interest. Many credit card issuers calculate interest daily using your average daily balance. Compounding interest means unpaid balances can grow quickly.

The statement balance (sometimes called the new balance) is your total balance at the end of a billing cycle. You can avoid incurring interest charges by paying the statement balance in full by your payment due date. The current balance is a running total that includes any charges, fees, payments and credits that have been posted to your account. This includes any previous balances, new charges and payments you've made. You can see it by checking your credit card account online or in your card issuer's app. In addition to these balances, your statement lists a minimum monthly payment. This is the least you can pay in a billing cycle and still keep your account in good standing. Card issuers may calculate the minimum payment based on a flat percentage of your balance or based on a percentage plus interest and fees. Statement Balance | Current Balance | ---|---| What it is | Amount you owe at end of billing cycle | Amount you currently owe | ---|---|---| What it includes | Previous unpaid balance plus transactions posted to your account during the billing cycle | Any unpaid balance plus transactions posted to your account after your last statement closed | ---|---|---| When it updates | Monthly
