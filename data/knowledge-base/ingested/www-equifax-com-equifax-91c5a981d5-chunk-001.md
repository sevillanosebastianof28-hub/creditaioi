Debt consolidation is a debt management strategy that combines your outstanding debt into a new loan with just one monthly payment. You can consolidate multiple credit cards or a mix of credit cards and other loans such as a student loan or a mortgage. Consolidation does not automatically erase your debt, but it does provide some borrowers with the tools they need to pay back what they owe more effectively. The goal of consolidation is twofold. First, consolidation condenses multiple monthly payments, often owed to different lenders, into a single payment. Second, it can make repayment less expensive. By combining multiple balances into a new loan with a lower interest rate, you can reduce cumulative interest, which is the sum of all interest payments made over the life of a loan.

You can also borrow against your 401(k) retirement account to consolidate debts. Although 401 (k) loans don't require credit checks, dipping into your retirement savings is a dangerous prospect, and you stand to lose out on accumulating interest. Consolidation can certainly be a tidy solution to repaying your debt, but there are a few things to know before you take the plunge. Debt consolidation loans and your credit scores Before you're approved for a debt consolidation loan, lenders will evaluate your credit reports and credit scores to help them determine whether to offer you a loan and at what terms. High credit scores mean you'll be more likely to qualify for a loan with favorable terms for debt consolidation. Generally, borrowers with scores of 740 or higher will receive the best interest rates, followed by those in the 739 to 670 range. If your credit score is lower than 670, debt consolidation may not be a good option for you. Consolidating debt when you have bad credit can be challenging. Although
