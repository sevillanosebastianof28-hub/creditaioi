Learn about our editorial policies Close The insurance sector is made up of companies that offer risk management in the form of insurance contracts. The basic concept of insurance is that one party, the insurer, will guarantee payment for an uncertain future event. Meanwhile, another party, the insured or the policyholder, pays a smaller premium to the insurer in exchange for that protection on that uncertain future occurrence. As an industry, insurance is regarded as a slow-growing, safe sector for investors and includes both stock and mutual companies. This perception is not as strong as it was in the 1970s and 1980s, but it is still generally true when compared to other financial sectors.

In some cases, insurance companies will partner with banks to market their products to the bank's customers. This practice, known as "bancasurance" is more common in Europe, but is finding a foothold in the United States. One of the more interesting features of insurance companies is that they are essentially allowed to use their customers' money to invest for themselves. This makes them similar to banks, but investing happens to an even greater extent. This is sometimes referred to as "the float." Float occurs when one party extends money to another party and does not expect repayment until after a circumstantial event. This mechanism essentially means insurance companies have a positive cost of capital. This distinguishes them from private equity funds, banks, and mutual funds. For investors in stock insurance companies (or policyholders in mutual companies), this means the potential for lower-risk, stable returns. Insurance plans are the principal product of the sector.
