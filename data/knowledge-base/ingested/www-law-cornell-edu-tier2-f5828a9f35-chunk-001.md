Our collection aims to show each section of the U.C.C. in the version which is most widely adopted by states. That means we will not always display the most current revision if that revision has not achieved widespread adoption among American legislatures. [Due to license restrictions, this on-line version of the U.C.C. does not include the official comments.] [We also offer the U.C.C. as enacted by a particular state and proposed revisions to articles .]
