Our primary website, FTC.gov, informs and engages the public about how the agency protects consumers and competition and provides resources for consumers and businesses. The site guides the public to other FTC websites that enable them to report fraud and scams, register for Do Not Call, obtain a free credit report, and get help if they are victims of identity theft. We follow federal guidelines to ensure that the site is accessible, usable, inclusive, efficient, and protects the privacy of users. Have questions or feedback?
