What is a Co-Signer? You might want to help a loved one obtain a loan by cosigning. Learn more about the pros and cons of cosigning loans so you can be sure you know what you’re getting into as a cosigner. [Duration- 2:27] Highlights: A co-signer is a person who agrees to be legally responsible for someone else's debt. - If a borrower has low credit scores or little to no credit history, adding a co-signer to their loan application may give them a better chance of being approved by the lender. - Co-signers agree to be held legally responsible for a debt should the primary borrower fall behind on what they owe. A co-signed debt also appears on the co-signer's credit reports and may influence their credit scores as if the debt were their own. - Co-signers offer valuable support to borrowers with low credit scores or a limited credit history. Adding a financially experienced co-signer to a loan or lease may improve the chances of an applicant's approval. However, co-signing an agreement can also have negative consequences for the co-signer's financial well-being. What does it mean to co-sign a loan? A co-signer is a person who agrees to take legal responsibility for someone else's debt. If the primary borrower fails to meet their financial obligations on a loan or lease, the co-signer is held accountable for any missed payments. A co-signed debt will also appear on the co-signer's credit reports and can influence their credit scores as if the debt were their own. When someone co-signs a loan or lease, they undertake a certain level of financial risk. However, they do not gain access to any of the funds or property tied to the co-signed agreement. That's why co-signers are most frequently family members or close friends who are willing to put their own finances on the line for a loved one. Why would a loan need a co-signer? Co-signers act as an additional safety net for lenders. Should the primary borrower fall behind on payments, the co-signer is legally responsible for the debt. If a borrower has limited income, low credit scores or little to no credit history, adding a co-signer may help a lender feel more confident in approving their application. Additionally, a co-signer may help a borrower qualify for a larger principal, reduced interest rate or other improved loan terms. Lenders allow co-signers on many different types of debt including personal loans, auto loans, leases and mortgages. What are the responsibilities of a co-signer? Acting as a co-signer can have serious financial consequences. First, co-signers assume legal responsibility for a debt. So, if the primary borrower is unable to pay as agreed, the co-signer may have to pay the full amount of what's owed. Second, a co-signed loan will appear on the co-signer's credit reports. The co-signer's credit scores may be positively or negatively impacted by the borrower's credit behavior. Co-signing for someone is a significant commitment. So, don't fill out a credit application without having an in-depth financial discussion with the primary borrower. It's important to talk to the borrower about their ability to stay on top of their payments and to form a plan in case they fall behind on their financial obligations. Pros of co-signing a loan Generally speaking, it's the primary borrower who benefits most when you co-sign a loan. However, it's also an opportunity to have a positive impact for a borrower in a tight financial spot. For example, co-signing a personal loan allows you to help a young friend or family member build a credit history, thus preparing them to qualify for even more new credit later. Similarly, if someone in your family has an impaired credit history or low credit scores, co-signing a loan may help them secure a bigger principal or less expensive loan terms. In this
