the Best Card Since your options are limited, start with the type of credit card most likely to approve you. Student credit cards are often easiest for college students, while secured credit cards work well for anyone. Many card issuers allow you to prequalify with no credit check. This can give you an idea of your approval odds before applying. When comparing credit cards, look at the annual fee, interest rate and reward programs. Make sure the card reports to all three major credit bureaus so your payment history helps you build credit. Learn more: What Credit Card Should I Get? Apply You must be at least 18 to apply for a credit card. If you're under age 21, issuers may require proof of your income or a cosigner. Once you've chosen a credit card, you can apply online in minutes. Be prepared to provide: Your name and address - Date of birth - Social Security number - Monthly or annual income - Housing costs - School details if applying for a student card - Approval decisions are often instant. If you're applying for a secured credit card, you'll also make your security deposit at this stage. Tip: Avoid applying for too many credit cards in a short period of time.

To build strong credit: Read the terms. Understand the interest rate, fees, rewards and other features of your credit card so you know how to use it and minimize your costs. - Use your card regularly. Make small purchases that you can easily repay. Gas, groceries and streaming subscriptions are a good place to start. Maintaining reasonable spending habits keeps you out of debt. - Make timely payments. Each month you have a balance, you'll be required to make a monthly payment by a specific date. Pay at least the minimum by the due date to build a positive payment history and avoid late fees. - Keep a low balance. Ideally, you should pay in full each month to avoid interest. If you carry a balance, keep it low relative to your credit limit to protect your credit score. - Upgrade or expand your cards. After several months of responsible use, many secured credit cards may graduate you to an unsecured card.
