The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2020 charged the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority with developing and enforcing rules relating to racetrack safety, anti-doping, and medication control, with the goal of applying uniform, national standards to thoroughbred horseracing. The Act expressly provides for Commission oversight of the Authority. Under the Act, the Commission must approve or disapprove any proposed rules or rule modifications of the Authority, and any final civil sanctions imposed by the Authority may be appealed to the Commission. The Commission has also issued its own rules to promote transparency and integrity in the Authority’s operations, and to govern the process for budget and rule submissions and enforcement appeals to the Commission.
