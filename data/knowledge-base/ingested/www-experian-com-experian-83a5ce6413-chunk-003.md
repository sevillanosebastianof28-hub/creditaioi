can cost up to 2% if you pay off your loan early. - Total loan cost: Before formally applying for the loan, consider your potential savings in the long run. For example, let's say you have $10,000 in high-interest credit card debt with an average APR of 29%. You'd have to make payments of around $419 per month to pay off the balance in three years, with interest charges totaling $5,086. If you consolidated this debt into a new loan with a 12% APR over the same period, your payment would drop to $332 and your interest charges would plummet to $1,957, saving you $3,129. - 5. Apply for a Debt Consolidation Loan Once you find the best loan offer, it's time to take the next step and formally apply. Fortunately, the process is relatively straightforward. You can apply online, by phone or in person in minutes. You'll need to provide some personal, employment and income information as well as your reason for borrowing. Be prepared to submit documents that verify your identity, address and income. The lender will perform a hard credit pull to review your creditworthiness, which may temporarily lower your score by a few points. Online lenders can often approve your loan application in a few minutes, while traditional banks and credit unions may take longer. If approved, carefully read the loan documents to make sure the terms are what you've agreed to and look for any origination fees that could increase your total loan costs. 6. Close the Debt Consolidation Loan Before signing anything, make sure you fully understand and agree with the loan terms. If everything looks good and you're ready to move forward, sign the agreement to close the loan and receive the funds. Debt consolidation loans are usually funded in one of two ways: Lender pays creditors. You may have the option for your lender to pay your creditors directly. In that case, you'll need to provide them with account details, payoff amounts and other required information for the debts you want to settle. - You pay creditors. You might prefer to have your lender deposit the funds into your bank account so you can pay off your debts yourself. Depending on the lender, you may receive the money as soon as the same day or within a few days. - Make sure to pay off your accounts right away before interest accrues and increases your final payoff amounts. Check your account online or call your creditor to make sure the balance is fully paid before closing any old accounts. If you think you'll be tempted to rack up a big balance on your newly paid-off credit cards, closing them can help prevent additional debt. However, keeping an older credit account open can help you maintain a lower credit utilization ratio and a longer credit history, which accounts for 30% and 15% of your FICOÂ® Score, respectively. If you do keep a card open, use it sparingly and pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges and new debt from adding up.
