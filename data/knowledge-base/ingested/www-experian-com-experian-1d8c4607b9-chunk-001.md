Identity Theft Victim Assistance Quick Answer If youâve been a victim of identity theft, acting quickly is critical. Take these steps to review your credit reports, report fraud, place fraud alerts or security freezes and protect yourself in the future. Identity theft victim assistance is available to repair financial, credit or legal damage after someone misuses your personal information to commit fraud. If you suspect identity theft, it's important to act quickly to protect your credit and avoid further harm to your finances. Take these steps if you believe you're a victim of identity theft. 1. Review Your Credit Report and Accounts Reviewing copies of your latest credit reports from each of the three national consumer credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) can help you spot attempts to open fraudulent credit accounts in your name. You can get free weekly reports from all three bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com. Experian also provides free daily access to your credit report through a free membership, which includes credit monitoring. Pay special attention to the following sections of your credit reports when you suspect identity theft: Inquiries: This section includes information on lenders that have conducted credit checks in response to new credit applications. If you see an inquiry for a credit application you don't recognize, contact the lender for more information. Fraudulent inquiries can be a sign of attempted identity theft, even if no new account was opened. - Accounts: This section shows loans and credit cards opened in your name. If you see any unfamiliar accounts, contact the lender immediately so they can investigate. Be aware, however, that these could be legitimate accounts that are being reported under a business name that's unfamiliar to you. - Tip: Unfamiliar credit report entries may be harmless, like a lender financing your new cellphone. But if you can't confirm the reason for an entry, work with the lender to resolve it. Learn more: What to Look for When You Review Your Credit Report 2. File an Identity Theft Report If you confirm that a lender has received a credit application or issued a loan or credit to someone in your name, start by reporting identity theft on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website, IdentityTheft.gov. The site provides step-by-step guidance on which authorities to notify about different kinds of fraud and identity theft. You can also report fraud to the FTC by phone at 877-438-4338. Where else to file a report depends on the type of fraud committed, but may include: Your local police: You may need to file a report with law enforcement in the jurisdiction where you live if creditors, financial institutions or other entities require it to investigate the fraud, or if you have information that could help the police. - The IRS: If your Social Security number (SSN) has been stolen, thieves may try to claim your tax refund by filing a bogus tax return. You can check for tax fraud and report potential identity theft at the IRS website or by phoning 800-908-4490. - The FBI: If you believe your personal information has been used to commit online fraud, report it to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). - Your state's motor vehicles department: If your driver's license is lost or stolen, report it immediately to your state motor vehicles department. A driver's license can be used to get other personal credentials such as a birth certificate or Social Security Card. - The U.S. State Department: If your passport is lost or stolen, criminals could use it to steal your identity. Contact the U.S. State Department passport agency right away. - The U.S. Postal Service: If identity theft was committed through postal mail, file a report with the Postal Inspection Service as soon as possible. - Learn more: How to Report Identity Theft 3.
