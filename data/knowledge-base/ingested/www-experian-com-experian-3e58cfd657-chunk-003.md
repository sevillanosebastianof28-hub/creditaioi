In addition to paying your bills on time and working to pay down credit card balances, this may mean bringing past-due accounts current or working with a credit counselor to get on a debt management plan. Check Your Credit Before Applying While your credit isn't the only factor that credit card issuers consider, your credit score can impact your ability to qualify for a new card as well as the interest rate and credit limit you receive. If you don't know where you currently stand, you can check your credit score for free on Experian. You can also use the free Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸ service to add your cellphone, NetflixÂ® and utility payments to your credit report.
