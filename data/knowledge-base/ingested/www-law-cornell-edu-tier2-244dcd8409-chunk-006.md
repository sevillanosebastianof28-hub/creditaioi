or person of a member of the Justice’s family as defined in Canon 4D(3). As a family fiduciary a Justice is subject to the following restrictions: (1) The Justice should not serve if it is likely that as a fiduciary the Justice would be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the Justice or if the estate, trust, or ward becomes involved in adversary proceedings before the Court or in a court under the Court’s jurisdiction. (2) While acting as a fiduciary, a Justice is subject to the same restrictions on financial activities that apply to a Justice in a personal capacity. F. Governmental Appointments. A Justice may accept appointment to a governmental committee, commission, or other position only if it is one that concerns the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice, or if appointment of a Justice is authorized by federal law. A Justice should not, in any event, accept such an appointment if the Justice’s governmental duties would tend to undermine public confidence in the integrity, impartiality, or independence of the judiciary. A Justice may participate in national, state, or local ceremonial occasions or in connection with historical, educational, and cultural activities. G. Chambers. Resources, and Staff. A Justice should not to any substantial degree use judicial chambers, resources, or staff to engage in activities that do not materially support official functions or other activities permitted under these Canons. H. Compensation. Reimbursement. Financial Reporting. A Justice may accept reasonable compensation and reimbursement of expenses for permitted activities if the source of the payments does not give the appearance of influencing the Justice’s official duties or otherwise appear improper. Expense reimbursement should be limited to the actual or reasonably estimated costs of travel, food, and lodging reasonably incurred by the Justice and, where appropriate to the occasion, by the Justice’s spouse or relative. For some time, all Justices have agreed to comply with the statute governing financial disclosure, and the undersigned Members of the Court each individually reaffirm that commitment. Canon 5: A Justice Should Refrain from Political Activity. A Justice should not: (1) act as a leader or hold any office in a political organization; (2) make speeches for a political organization or candidate, or publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office; or (3) solicit funds for, pay an assessment to, or make a contribution to a political organization or candidate, or attend or purchase a ticket for a dinner or other event sponsored by a political organization or candidate. A Justice should resign the judicial office if he or she becomes a candidate in a primary or general election for any office. A Justice should not engage in other political activity. This provision does not prevent a Justice from engaging in activities described in Canon 4. The undersigned Members of the Court subscribe to this Code and the accompanying Commentary. John G. Roberts, Jr. Clarence Thomas Samuel A. Alito, Jr. Sonia Sotomayor Elena Kagan Neil M. Gorsuch Brett M. Kavanaugh Amy Coney Barrett Ketanji Brown Jackson November 13, 2023 Commentary This Code of Conduct is substantially derived from the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, but adapted to the unique institutional setting of the Supreme Court. In certain instances, the foregoing Canons provide fairly specific guidance. A Justice, for example, “should not testify voluntarily as a character witness.” Canon 2B. A Justice “may serve as the executor . . . only for the estate, trust, or person of a member of the Justice’s family.” Canon 4E. In many cases, however, these Canons are broadly worded general principles informing conduct, rather than specific rules requiring no exercise of judgment or discretion. It is not always clear, for example, whether particular conduct undermines, promotes, or has no effect on “public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary,” Canon 2A, or whether
