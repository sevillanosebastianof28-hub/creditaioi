12 Factors That Affect Your Car Insurance Costs Quick Answer The cost of car insurance is affected by factors including your age, gender, location and marital status; the vehicle you drive; your annual mileage; your driving record; your claims history and even your credit score. Wouldn't it be nice to spend less on ho-hum necessities like car insurance? Understanding what determines your auto insurance premiums can uncover new ways to save. Auto insurance rates depend on factors such as your age, gender, location, the kind of car you drive, your driving record and possibly even your credit score. Here are 12 things that can influence the cost of your car insurance. 1. Your Location Car insurance premiums vary from state to state, and even from one ZIP code to another. Why? Big-city drivers face greater risk of accidents, car theft or vandalism, so they generally pay more for car insurance. - Car repairs and medical care for injuries are more expensive in some areas than in others. - Weather-related risks that can damage vehicles, such as wildfires or windstorms, are more common in certain locations. - Learn more: Will My Car Insurance Go Up After an Accident? 2. Your Age Younger, less experienced drivers are statistically more likely to drive dangerously and to be involved in fatal accidents, data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) shows. As a result, teens and young adults typically pay the highest rates for auto insurance. Once you turn 25, car insurance premiums typically go down and continue to drop as you get older.

As a result, married couples typically enjoy premiums 5% to 15% lower than singles. Married couples with two or more cars may also get price breaks for insuring multiple vehicles. 5.

Being at fault in an accident or having a DUI/DWI on your record are also likely to boost your car insurance costs. 6. The Vehicle You Drive Auto insurance rates may vary based on the vehicle you drive, including factors such as: How much your car costs to repair - How expensive your car is to replace - Whether your vehicle is popular with car thieves - The size of the engine - The car's safety record and features - How much damage the vehicle is likely to cause in a collision - Whether the car is financed is also a factor; lenders typically insist you carry more than the minimum required amount of insurance.
