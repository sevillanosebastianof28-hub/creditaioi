Wex is a free legal dictionary and encyclopedia sponsored and hosted by the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School. The goal of the Wex project is to use law students to demystify legal language to the best of our collective ability. Nothing in Wex should be construed as legal advice, nor should it be considered to be the position or opinion of Cornell University, Cornell Law School, or the faculty of either. More information about Wex can be found in our Wex Definitions page. Here's a list of all pages.
