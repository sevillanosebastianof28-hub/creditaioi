How to Get a Credit Card if You Donât Have a Credit History Quick Answer If you donât have a credit history, you can start with a secured credit card, store card or student credit card. Alternative options like a credit-builder loan or authorized user status can help you build credit before your first credit card. Getting a credit card can be challenging when you're just getting started. If you don't have a credit history, consider applying for a secured credit card or card designed for credit newbies. Can You Get a Credit Card With No Credit? Yes, you can get a credit card with no credit history, but your options may be more limited compared to someone with an established credit history. Some starter credit cards require a security deposit while others are geared toward students or have limited use. Without a credit history, credit card issuers can't predict your payment habits. Because of this, they typically charge more interest and limit how much credit they'll extend you. Fortunately, after several months of responsible use, you can begin building a credit history and eventually qualify for a broader range of credit cards.

Secured Credit Card A secured credit card works like a regular credit card, but requires a refundable security deposit as collateral, often as low as $200. Your security deposit typically becomes your credit limit, so a $200 deposit equals a $200 credit limit. The deposit lowers the risk for the card issuer and makes approval more likely. As long as you make your payments on time, your deposit will be refunded when you close the account in good standing. Some issuers refund the deposit when the card automatically graduates to an unsecured version. Be sure to keep up with your payments. If you default, the card issuer will keep the deposit to cover the balance. Start building your credit Store Credit Card A store credit card is offered through a retailer and typically can only be used with that brand or its partner. Because they have lower credit requirements, store credit cards are often easier to qualify for without a credit history. These cards often include perks such as discounts, rewards, free shipping and special financing. However, they generally carry higher interest rates and lower credit limits compared to traditional credit cards. Student Credit Card If you're a college student, you may qualify for a student credit card. These cards usually require proof of enrollment in a two- or four-year college or university. While credit limits may be low, many student cards offer benefits like low introductory interest rates and rewards. Some card issuers restrict the number of credit cards you can open as a student, helping prevent you from taking on too much credit too quickly. How to Get a Credit Card With No Credit History Follow these steps to get a credit card without a credit history. Decide on the Best Card Since your options are limited, start with the type of credit card most likely to approve you. Student credit cards are often easiest for college students, while secured credit cards work well for anyone. Many card issuers allow you to prequalify with no credit check. This can give you an idea of your approval odds before applying. When comparing credit cards, look at the annual fee, interest rate and reward programs. Make sure the card reports to all three major credit bureaus so your payment history helps you build credit. Learn more: What Credit Card Should I Get?
