annualized return of about 10%. | APYs on CDs are typically much higher than what you'd earn with a traditional savings account. | Most CDs will charge a fee if you take your money out before the account matures. The fee could be as high as 540 days' worth of interest. | CDs can help diversify your investments and offset risk in your portfolio. | If your money is locked into a CD, you could miss out on interest rate increases. | Who Should Get a CD? Whether a CD is right for you will depend on several factors, including: Your financial situation: If you're building an emergency fund or paying down high-interest debt, you're likely better off putting extra income toward those goals. - Your timeline: If you're OK with giving up access to your money for a predetermined amount of time, you could secure steady returns with a CD. - Your investment portfolio: Holding a variety of different assets is important for spreading out investment risk. In this way, adding CDs to the mix could help balance your portfolio. - Current interest rates: If you're able to find a competitive interest rate, it could put some muscle behind your savingsâespecially if you expect rates to drop soon. Pay attention to interest rate trends and look at CDs from different financial institutions. - How to Choose the Best CD Compare APYs. Rates can vary from one financial institution to the next. Shop around and compare rates from traditional banks, credit unions and online banks to determine where your money will earn the most interest. - Consider minimum deposit requirements. If you have a large chunk of money to invest, you might be able to secure a higher interest rate. If not, don't stress. Many CDs don't require a minimum opening deposit. Again, shopping around is key. - Look at term lengths. How long are you willing to part with your money? It's an important question since early withdrawal penalties could eat into your earnings. Decide on a term range that works for you, then compare rates to find the best CD. - Clarify early withdrawal penalties. Before opening a CD, read the fine print to clarify the early withdrawal penalty. It's a good thing to know, especially if you're hit with a financial surprise and need to access that money. It's another reason to build a strong emergency fund. - Know your options when the term ends. Clarify what will happen when the account matures. You'll likely have a short amount of time to add more money to your CD or take your cash elsewhere. FYI, some CDs will automatically renew if you don't make a decision within seven to 10 days. - Learn more: Can You Lose Money With a CD? What Is a CD Ladder? A CD ladder is when you open multiple CDs of varying term lengths, and it's a strategy that could help your money go even further. Spreading them out can provide an ongoing source of income because you'll unlock a chunk of cash as each one matures. When that happens, you can either reinvest that money or put it toward your financial goals. Let's say you invest: $1,000 in a one-year CD at 3.8% - $3,000 in a six-month CD at 4.5% - $1,000 in an 18-month CD at 4% - When all is said and done, you'll earn more than $165 in interest. You could earn even more over time if you continue CD laddering. Alternatives to CDs If you decide that a CD isn't the best option for you, you can consider one of these alternatives: Money Market Account | High-Yield Savings Account | Investment Account | ---|---|---| Current average APY | 0.88%* | 1.71%* | N/A | ---|---|---|---| FDIC or NCUA Insurance? | Yes | Yes | No, but brokerage
