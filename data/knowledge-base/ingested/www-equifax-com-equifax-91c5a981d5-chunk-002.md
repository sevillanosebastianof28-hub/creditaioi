are a few things to know before you take the plunge. Debt consolidation loans and your credit scores Before you're approved for a debt consolidation loan, lenders will evaluate your credit reports and credit scores to help them determine whether to offer you a loan and at what terms. High credit scores mean you'll be more likely to qualify for a loan with favorable terms for debt consolidation. Generally, borrowers with scores of 740 or higher will receive the best interest rates, followed by those in the 739 to 670 range. If your credit score is lower than 670, debt consolidation may not be a good option for you. Consolidating debt when you have bad credit can be challenging. Although you may be approved for a loan, the interest rates offered to you will likely be high and may negate the savings you hoped to achieve by consolidating your debt. It's also important to understand that debt consolidation involves taking out a new loan. As with any other type of loan, the application process and the loan itself can affect your credit scores. Weigh the pros and cons of debt consolidation and how it might affect your credit scores to decide whether it's the right path for you. Pros Credit Utilization. Your credit utilization ratio, the amount of revolving credit you're using divided by the total credit available to you, contributes to your credit scores. Lenders interpret high credit utilization ratios (usually above 30%) as an indicator of risk. So, if you have several credit cards open and each is carrying a large balance, your credit utilization ratio will be high, which typically translates to lower credit scores. However, credit cards and personal loans are considered two separate types of debt when assessing your credit mix, which accounts for 10% of your FICO credit score. So if you consolidate multiple credit card debts into one new personal loan, your credit utilization ratio and credit score could improve. - Payment History. If you have been struggling with high-interest debt, you already know that missed payments can quickly drag down your credit scores. Debt consolidation offers a solution: if you are able to obtain lower interest rates and lower payments, then it may be easier to meet your monthly obligation and avoid a negative hit to your credit scores. - Cons Hard Inquiries. When you apply for loans, including those for debt consolidation, potential lenders review your credit reports, which generates what's known as a hard inquiry. Hard inquiries help lenders track how often you apply for new credit accounts. Each new inquiry may knock your credit scores down a few points, so you'll want to be sure that you only apply for loans for which you're likely to be approved. - Newer Accounts. The average age of your accounts has a big impact on your credit scores. Opening a new account will lower the average age of your accounts, and you might see a corresponding drop in your credit scores. Closing credit accounts that have been paid off will generally have the same effect. - Alternatives to debt consolidation Consolidation isn't the only option for debtholders looking for relief. Consider these alternatives: Debt management plans. Some non-profit credit counseling services offer debt management programs, where counselors work directly with the creditor to secure lower interest rates and monthly payments. This approach may help you avoid taking out a new loan, but there's a catch. You'll also lose the ability to open new credit accounts as long as the debt management plan is in place. Credit card refinancing. Credit card refinancing involves transferring your debt onto a new balance transfer credit card with an interest rate as low as 0%. This introductory rate is only temporary, however, and these kinds of cards are difficult to get without good credit scores. Bankruptcy. Filing
