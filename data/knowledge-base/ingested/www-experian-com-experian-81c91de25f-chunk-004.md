on Business Loans and Credit Cards Interest on loans or credit cards you've used to cover business expenses is deductible. Only the portion of interest that applies to business expenses qualifies, however: If 40% of the balance on your credit card was used for personal expenses, you may only deduct the 60% of your total interest that relates to business expenses.

Bad business debts are often the result of extending credit to clients or customers, or to employees, distributors or suppliers. To be deductible, a bad debt (or partial debt) must have been included in your gross income in the current year or a previous year. 16. Professional Memberships Memberships in business organizations may be deductible, but they must be business-related (not entertainment-related). Joining a country club won't qualify for a deduction, but membership fees for your local chamber of commerce or a professional organization related to your industry generally will. 17. Education Training and education may be deductible if it maintains or improves required business skills, or if it's required by law or regulation. Examples include continuing education needed to maintain a license or classes to update your technical skills. Education that trains you for a new trade or business isn't eligible.
