banned cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate.14 The Court held that, at least in theory, states could prohibit such cross burnings as a “true threat.” 15 Specifically, intimidation can be prohibited as “a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.” 16 Cross burning could fall within this category of “intimidating speech,” given that the “history of cross burning in this country” demonstrated they were often “intended to create a pervasive fear in victims that they are a target of violence.” 17 However, the Court concluded that the specific state law before it was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed the mere fact of cross burning to provide prima facie evidence of the intent to intimidate, creating a chill on constitutionally protected speech.18 Footnotes - 1 - R.A.V. v.

A cross burning done as “a statement of ideology, a symbol of group solidarity,” or “in movies such as Mississippi Burning,” however, would be protected speech. Id. at 365–366 (plurality opinion). -
