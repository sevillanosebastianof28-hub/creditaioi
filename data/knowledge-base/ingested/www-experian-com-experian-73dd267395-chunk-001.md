How to Save on Car Insurance: 9 Ways to Lower Your Rates Quick Answer You can save money on car insurance by shopping around, downgrading your coverage, dropping unneeded extras, raising your deductible, looking for discounts and more. Car insurance offers essential protection for your vehicle, but it can get expensive. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to reduce the cost. You can save money on car insurance by shopping around, adjusting your coverage, raising your deductible and canceling unnecessary extras. Try these tips to pay less for car insurance. 1. Look for Discounts Insurance companies offer a wide range of car insurance discounts. Some of the most common include: Good student discounts for maintaining a certain grade point average in high school or college - Senior discounts, which typically apply to accident-free drivers 55 and up - Safe driving discounts may apply if you've taken a defensive driving course or gone a certain number of years accident-free - Affiliation discounts for members of certain organizations, current or former military service members, federal employees or employees of certain organizations - Payment-related discounts for paying your annual premium upfront or setting up automatic payments - Digital discounts for getting a quote online, signing documents online or receiving documents and statements digitally - 2. Compare Prices At least once a year, review your existing auto insurance and get quotes from other insurance companies to see if there's a cheaper option. Be sure to compare the same coverage levels and deductibles from one company to another. If you find a better rate, contact your insurance company to see if they're willing to match it. You might be able to save without switching insurers. 3. Raise Your Deductible The deductible is how much you pay out of pocket whenever you have a claim before your insurance coverage pays out. Deductibles may range from $0 to $2,500 or so. Increasing your deductible can lower your car insurance rate, but will cost you more in case of a claim. Before raising your deductible, consider the value of your vehicle and the size of your savings account. Opting for a bigger deductible could mean shelling out thousands of dollars if you ever file a claim. You can build a financial cushion for this by stashing the money you save in your emergency fund. Stop overpaying for insurance 4. Reduce Your Coverage If you have an older car that's paid off and not worth much money, you might save on your premiums by dropping collision and comprehensive coverage. Collision coverage pays to replace or repair your car if it's damaged due to a collision while driving. Comprehensive coverage pays if your car is stolen or damaged when you aren't driving. Both are typically included in standard car insurance and are limited to the value of your car. If your deductible is $500 and you total a car worth $2,000, insurance would only pay $1,500. It might make more financial sense to cancel collision and comprehensive coverage and put the savings toward a new car. Learn more: What to Do if You Can't Afford Car Insurance 5. Cancel Unnecessary Add-Ons Your car insurance could come with extras you aren't even aware you're paying for. Review your policy, looking for add-ons you may not need. These may include: Rental reimbursement coverage that pays for a rental car while your vehicle is being repaired for a covered loss - Windshield replacement coverage that repairs or replaces windows and windshields with a low deductible or no deductible - New-car replacement insurance that replaces a car totaled within a certain number of years or miles with an equivalent new car - Roadside assistance coverage if your car breaks down on the road - Some add-on coverage may be worth keeping, depending on your needs. For example, if you don't belong to another roadside
