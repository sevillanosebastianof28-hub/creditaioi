Inactive Sometimes, the reason for a declined debit card is as simple as an expired or inactive card. Your debit card automatically disables once it expires. As such, you'll need to get a replacement card and activate it to ensure any new transactions are approved. Your bank should automatically send you a new card before your current one expires. But if your card's expiration date is approaching and you still haven't received a replacement, contact your financial institution immediately to request a new one. Your new card should come with activation instructions. Typically, you can activate the card online, over the phone or by using it at an ATM.

Your Card Is on Hold Your bank may temporarily suspend your card to prevent it from completing transactions. This hold is typically a preventive measure against potential fraud or unauthorized use. For example, your bank may lock your card if there's been a data breach at a retailer where you've used your debit card. Transactions you've made while traveling could also lead to a hold on your card Preauthorization holds with hotels, rental car agencies and other businesses can also be problematic. In these cases, a merchant places a temporary hold on your card that lifts once you settle the final bill. If you're traveling and anticipate dealing with one or more holds, consider using a credit card for the hotel and rental car and your debit card for other purchases, or vice-versa, to avoid tying up funds you may need. 6. Your Card Is Damaged or Expired A worn-out magnetic strip or damaged chip on your debit card may be all it takes to trip up a transaction. With repeated use over time, your card can wear down and stop working properly. If it's damaged, call your bank or credit union and request a new card. Similarly, your bank should automatically send you a new card before your current one expires. But if your card's expiration date is approaching and you still haven't received a replacement, contact your financial institution immediately to request a new one. And once you receive your new card, make sure to update any autosaved payments since you will have a new expiration date and CVV. 7. You've Exceeded Your Daily Purchase Limit Your debit card could be declined if the purchase would cause you to exceed your bank's daily transaction limit. Banks place limits on debit cards to protect youâand themselvesâfrom thieves who might rack up excessive purchases on your account if they get access to your debit card. Daily purchase limits vary by bank but typically range from $300 to $7,500. Here are the daily purchase limits for several popular banks. Financial Institution | Daily Transaction Limit | ---|---| Alliant Credit Union | $300 to $2,000 | Ally | $5,000 ($500 to $2,000 for new customers) | Capital One | $5,000 | Chase Bank | $400 to $7,500 | Navy Federal Credit Union | $3,000 to $5,000 | SoFi | $6,000 | In addition to daily purchase limits, your bank likely has a daily ATM withdrawal limit. These limits usually range from $300 to $1,000 per day, but you may want to contact your bank to determine their specific limit. 8. You're Traveling You
