options. 1. Open a Student or Secured Credit Card You can open your own credit card starting at age 18. College students can apply for a student credit card, which is often easier to get approved for as a first credit card than a regular card. However, student cards are unsecured credit cards, so if you're under 21, you likely won't get approved unless you have proof of your own income or a parent cosigns. If you can't qualify for a student card, or you're not in school, consider a secured credit card to start building your credit instead. These require a security deposit, which typically becomes your credit limit. Secured cards are typically easier to obtain than regular unsecured cards since the deposit reduces the card issuer's risk. While timing can vary, if you use your card responsibly for six to 12 months and pay all its bills on time, your card issuer may upgrade you to an unsecured credit card and return your deposit. 2. Become an Authorized User on a Parent's Credit Card If one or both of your parents have a good credit history and use credit cards responsibly, consider asking them to add you as an authorized user. You'll likely receive your own card connected to their account, but you won't be required to pay the billâthough your parents might expect you to pay for your purchases. Some card issuers report authorized-user activity to the credit bureaus, which is one way to start building credit. Not all issuers report authorized users, however, so make sure your parents' issuer does so you'll benefit. 3. Pay Student Loans on Time If you've borrowed, or plan to borrow, student loans for college, lenders usually report your accounts and payments to the credit bureaus. Consistently making on-time loan payments can have a big impact in building positive credit history. Even if you defer making payments until after you finish school, student loans can help you establish good creditâif you make your payments on time every month once you start paying them back. 4. Consider a Credit-Builder Loan Geared toward building credit rather than borrowing money, some lenders offer a product called a credit-builder loan. With traditional loans, you borrow a lump sum of money and make monthly payments until it's repaid. Credit-builder loans still require monthly payments, but instead of you getting money upfront, the financial institution sets aside the loan amount (usually $300 to $1,000) in a savings account. You receive the money after making all monthly payments. You'll generally have to pay interest, but some lenders may return all or a portion of that interest once you've fully paid the loan. While you're not actually borrowing money, payments on credit-builder loans are typically reported to the credit bureaus like regular loans (make sure yours is reported to all three credit bureaus). This helps you build credit and savings at the same time. 5. Add Monthly Bills to your Experian Credit Report Typically, utility bills don't show up on your credit report since they're not a form of borrowing money (unless you don't pay and an account goes into collections). But there's a way around this. If you're responsible for your cellphone, utility, internet and streaming bills, you can add these accounts to your Experian credit report with Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸. Once they're in your report, on-time payments could help improve your credit history and increase your credit scores. Instantly raise your credit scoresÃ¸ 6.
