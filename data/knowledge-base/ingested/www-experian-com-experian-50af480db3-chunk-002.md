CD rates move up and down and can vary by term length, deposit amount and financial institution. APYs are largely affected by the federal funds rate, which is a benchmark rate set by the Federal Reserve. This is the rate banks pay to borrow money from each other. When it changes, financial institutions usually adjust the rates they offer on CDs and savings accounts. (The same goes for rates they charge on credit cards and loans.) When the federal funds rate goes up, CD rates typically do the same, and vice versa. Interest rates plummeted during the pandemic, but steadily moved upward in the years that followed. Inflation had a lot to do with it: Higher rates increase the cost of borrowing, which can help cool inflation. This was a silver lining for folks who invested in CDs. And for a long stretch, the Fed rate was 5.33%. But the Federal Reserve recently slashed that rate by 1 percentage point across three separate rate cuts in late 2024, and by another 0.50 percentage points in two cuts made in September and October 2025. Rates may drop further in the future, but we won't know until it happens. In light of that, you might decide that now is the best time to lock in current CD rates. Learn more: Are CDs Worth It? How Much Interest Will I Earn With a CD? The amount of interest you earn will depend on: The APY offered by your financial institution - The amount you deposit - Your CD term - Let's say you decide to put $10,000 into a CD at today's rates.

For example, some financial institutions may reserve their best rates for six-month CDs or those who open a jumbo CD with an extra-large deposit. This is why it's always important to compare CD rates and terms because no two CDs are alike. Types of CDs There are several different types of CDs out there. Understanding how they're alike and different can help you decide which one might be right for you. Below are some popular kinds of CDs: Traditional CD: With a traditional CD, you'll likely have a set term and fixed interest rate. After making an initial deposit, your money will earn interest until the account matures. You typically can't deposit moreâand your money is locked into the CD until the term ends. Tapping your funds early will likely result in an early withdrawal penalty. - No-penalty CD: These CDs, which are sometimes called liquid CDs, allow you to withdraw money early without being penalized. That can be a nice benefit, but traditional CDs usually offer better APYs. - Bump-up CD: With this type of CD, you can request an interest rate increase.
