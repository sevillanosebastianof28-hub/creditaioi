-- can be considered bad debt, as the high interest payments can be difficult for the borrower to pay back, often putting them in a worse financial situation. What to Do to Avoid Bad Debt If you’re making a purchase that increases your debt, ask yourself how this purchase will benefit you – not just today, but long term. Is the debt you’ll incur going to provide you a lasting benefit, or is it something that will satisfy an immediate desire that you can’t afford? It’s also a good idea to have a rainy-day or emergency fund for unexpected expenses, so you won’t have to use credit cards to pay them. Try to keep your debt to credit ratio (the ratio of how much you owe compared to the total amount of credit available to you) as low as possible to avoid being viewed as a risky borrower by lenders. Focus on paying the debt you have and restrict new purchases. Lastly, it’s always important to pay your bills on time, every time. Sign up for a credit monitoring & ID theft protection product today!
