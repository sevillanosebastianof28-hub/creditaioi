policies, assist with our updating efforts. Articles that have been updated are date-stamped to reflect this. Quality Standards Every article you see has multiple people behind it, continually working to make sure that it is responsible, accurate, understandable, helpful, and reflective of our editorial principles. Our editorial team approves all story ideas independently, and our expert contributors each have deep subject matter expertise in the topics that we assign them. Our team of professional editors, fact checkers, and producers review content to ensure it upholds our values of being empowering, inclusive, unbiased, and accurate. All staff are responsible for disclosing any potential conflicts of interest. Corrections Investopedia is committed to telling readers when an error has appeared, and to correcting it. This transparency applies to small and large mistakes, including news, but only if an error was made at the time of original publication. Corrections will be clearly noted on the page. When our journalism is factually correct, but the language is not as clear or detailed as necessary, the story may be updated without an editor's note. Please report possible errors to inv_editorial@investopedia.com. Writers Investopedia experts are carefully recruited, vetted, and chosen. Some are experienced financial writers, others are experts in particular aspects of finance; many are both. They are selected for their knowledge and skill in communicating complex topics in clear, accessible, actionable language. Every article’s author or reviewer is listed at the top of the page, to the left of the date, and is linked to their biography, which you can click on to learn more about their credentials, education, professional experience, and social media presence. All writers are required to uphold the editorial guidelines listed above. Third-Party Content We do not publish third-party content on Investopedia.

Our sources for our content are primary sources and can be seen on methodology pages, and in inline citations, as well as through attribution directly in the articles.
