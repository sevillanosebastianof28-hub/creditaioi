What Is a Credit-Builder Loan? Quick Answer A credit-builder loan is a way to build credit and savings at the same time. A lender sets aside a certain amount of its own money in a savings account, and you pay toward that account in monthly installments, then receive the balance at the end of the loan term. A credit-builder loan allows you to make fixed payments into a savings account over several months. At the end of the term, the lender will return to you the balance of the accountâpossibly including some of the interest you paidâand you'll strengthen your credit with positive payment history. If you have poor credit or no credit history, a credit-builder loan could be a good tool to demonstrate that you're a reliable borrower and build your score. But before you consider applying, here's more on how exactly credit-builder loans work, where to get one and alternatives to consider. How Does a Credit-Builder Loan Work? A credit-builder loan is a type of installment loan designed to help you build credit by establishing a positive payment history. You may be able to take out a credit-builder loan from around $300 to as much as $1,000, and loan terms typically range from six to 24 months. Credit-builder loans work in the opposite way that typical personal loans do. Instead of getting funds upfront in a lump sum, you make payments each month and receive your balance at the end of the loan term. Here's how it works: The lender earmarks funds. The lender sets aside a certain amount of its own money in a savings account. - You make monthly payments. You make installment payments toward the loan each month. - You build credit over time. Credit-builder lenders typically report your payment history to the credit bureaus, helping you strengthen your credit with on-time monthly payments. - You receive your money at the end of the loan term. Once you've paid the full loan amount, you'll get back the balance. - You may pay interest and fees. You'll typically pay interest on the loan, but the lender may return a portion of that paid interest or the interest earned on the savings while in the account to you at the end of the loan term. - How Can a Credit-Builder Loan Help My Credit? Credit-builder loans help you build credit by establishing a positive payment history. As a type of installment credit, credit-builder loans have fixed monthly payments. Making on-time payments contributes to healthy credit scores because payment history makes up 35% of your FICOÂ® ScoreÎ, the credit score used by 90% of top lenders. Your payment history has the single largest impact on your credit. By making on-time payments, you'll show lenders you can be trusted to take on other lines of credit in the future. That can help you build credit if you don't yet have any accounts, and it can help restore credit if you have negative marks on your credit report. Where to Get a Credit-Builder Loan You may be able to get a credit-builder loan from these different types of lenders: Credit unions: Many credit unions offer credit-builder loans; search your local institutions' websites to see your options. You'll need to become a member of the credit union to get a loan, and you'll qualify based on characteristics such as where you work or where you live. To join the credit union, you'll typically pay a membership fee of $5 to $25 or donate to a partner charity. - Community banks: These locally owned banks may also offer credit-builder loans, and they have a focus on financial education similar to credit unions. Search for a community bank near you using the Independent Community Bankers of America's search tool. - Lending circles: Peer groups can help each other build credit using lending circles,
