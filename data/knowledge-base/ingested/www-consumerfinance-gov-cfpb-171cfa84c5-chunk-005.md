information on which the Bureau sought public comments The correction and appeal process set forth in these guidelines does not apply upon first publication to information disseminated by the Bureau through a comprehensive public comment process – e.g., Federal Register notices of proposed rulemakings, regulatory analyses, and requests for comments on information collections subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. In most cases, comments concerning the quality of the disseminated information can be addressed through these procedures, such as by responding to a request for correction of the information in the preamble to a final rule. In unusual circumstances, the Bureau may determine that earlier consideration of such comments in accordance with these guidelines would be appropriate. For example, the procedures set forth in these guidelines should be used if the commenter has shown a reasonable likelihood of suffering actual harm if the comment is not resolved before issuance of the final action and the Bureau determines that resolving the matter pursuant to these guidelines will not unduly delay the final action. The Bureau will regularly review information products that have been disseminated to the public to ensure that they continue to meet high standards of quality, including objectivity, utility, and integrity. Responsibilities The Chief Information Officer will: Provide management and oversight to the Bureau-wide implementation of the guidelines - Develop and issue final Bureau information quality guidelines and post them on the Bureau website - Coordinate appropriate component guidance development with affected organizational units - Report to the Director of OMB on the number of and nature of complaints regarding compliance with the guidelines for the quality of disseminated information and how such complaints were resolved - Organizational components will: Designate a point of contact for compliance with the information quality processes within their organization - Develop, if necessary, information quality standards for ensuring and maximizing quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, including statistical information, consistent with these guidelines - Designate individual(s) responsible for reviewing and deciding the initial review of complaints and individual(s) responsible for reviewing and deciding appeals - Reporting requirements Bureau will consider public comments received in response to publication of these draft guidelines, and submit revised guidelines to OMB for review. Bureau will post notice of the availability of final guidelines in the Federal Register and post the final guidelines approved by OMB on its website. Bureau will provide annual reports to OMB indicating the number and nature of complaints received concerning agency compliance and how such complaints were resolved. Page last modified @
