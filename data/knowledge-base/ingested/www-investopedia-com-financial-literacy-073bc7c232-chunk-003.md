with the bankruptcy court. If you elected to have money withheld from your paychecks and deposited into a flexible spending account (FSA) for healthcare expenses, you should check with your company's benefits administrator to ensure that you receive compensation for the sums withheld. Transitioning from Group to Individual Insurance Plans Some insurance companies will allow you to convert from a canceled group plan to an individual plan. Typically, you will not have to provide any additional information when applying for an individual policy. However, you will need to complete some paperwork and cover all premium payments. The rules for converting to a personal policy vary by state, so you will need to check with your state insurance association. There is a small window of time in which you are allowed to convert from a group to an individual plan, so be sure to file papers in time. Also, keep in mind that in addition to shouldering the premium costs, you may find that some levels of coverage change with an individual plan. So plan ahead to avoid any surprises. Why Does Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Mean the End of All Coverage? Because in Chapter 7, a company closes its doors for good rather than reorganize under Chapter 11. When a company goes out of business, no employee benefits exist that could be extended. What's the Difference Between a Group Health Plan and an Individual Health Plan? A group plan is an arrangement between an employer (or other organization) and an insurance company whereby an entire group of employees can purchase the group plan through the employer. An individual plan is a health plan purchased directly from an insurer or through a marketplace. Can You Lose All Your Employer-Provided Insurance Benefits in Chapter 11? Yes, it's possible. If your employer's Chapter 11 reorganization plan calls for the elimination of all insurance plans as a way to improve the company's financial position, then company employees would lose all insurance coverage. The Bottom Line If you're concerned about your company's financial health and want to know how bankruptcy could affect you, take the time now to review your current insurance coverage. A company's bankruptcy can mean significant changes for your coverage, whether you keep your job or your workplace shuts down. Learn what options you may have to continue your current group plan coverage or to convert from a group plan to an individual plan. They can depend on whether the company has filed or is planning to file for a Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 proceeding.
