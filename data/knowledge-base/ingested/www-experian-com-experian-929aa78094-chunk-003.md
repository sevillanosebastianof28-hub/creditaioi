In rural areas, increased risks of wildlife collisions could make you more likely to get into an accident and file a claim. - Big cities may have higher frequencies of auto theft or vandalism, as well as more traffic congestion, compared to less populated areas. These could lead to more claims. - The cost of auto repairs or medical care can vary from one region to another, potentially impacting your insurance costs. - Severe weather risks differ from one state to another, with some areas having a greater risk of floods, tornadoes, hailstorms or other natural events that could damage your car. - Cheapest Car Insurance for Young Drivers in the U.S. Insuring new drivers can be costly. Younger drivers usually pay more for car insurance because they're statistically more likely to have accidents, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). On average, teen male drivers pay $3,384 annually for car insurance and teen female drivers pay $3,217 annually for car insurance, according to Experian data. Car insurance rates are usually highest for 16-year-olds and get cheaper when your child turns 25. Until then, you can save on car insurance by putting your child on your auto insurance instead of their own policy. A teenager on your policy benefits from the lower rates you may enjoy due to years of driving experience, homeownership or being married. If your young driver has a lot of accidents or moving violations in their driving record, your car insurance premiums are likely to rise. Buying separate coverage from an insurance provider focused on high-risk drivers could be cheaper in the long run. Many insurance companies discount auto insurance for young drivers who have good grades, attend college away from home without a car, or complete a safe driving course. The table below shows the insurance providers offering the cheapest full coverage car insurance in the U.S. for drivers ages 16 to 25.
