The FTC’s Criminal Liaison Unit helps prosecutors bring more criminal consumer fraud cases. The FTC’s civil enforcement actions shut down fraud and get restitution for consumers or disgorgement to the U.S. Treasury. Examples of FTC fraud cases include: telemarketing scams - mortgage and other debt relief rip-offs - bogus health products - sweepstakes scams - In many of its cases, the FTC often develops evidence that proves these defendants knew about the fraud. That evidence often supports criminal fraud prosecutions and includes: victim statements - undercover sales calls and purchases - certified bank, business, and phone records - insider testimony - FTC partners with the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys and other federal and state criminal law enforcers to stop consumer fraud. We: work cases in parallel proceedings - package cases for referrals to your agency - train your prosecutors and investigators on identifying suspects and witnesses using the Consumer Sentinel Network - supply free consumer education resources for outreach in your community -
