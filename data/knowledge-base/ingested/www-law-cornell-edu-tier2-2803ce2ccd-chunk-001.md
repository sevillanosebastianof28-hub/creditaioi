corruption Corruption is the dishonest, fraudulent, or criminal use of entrusted authority or power for personal gain or other unlawful or unethical benefits. Corruption occurs in politics, business, education, media, and other social and economic fields. A lack of transparency, accountability, and effective regulation are common causes of corruption. Corruption undermines institutional reputation and effectiveness, destabilizes governance, hinders economic development, distorts individual rights and freedoms, and weakens democracy and justice. Efforts to combat corruption include adopting clear rules to reduce legal ambiguities, implementing transparent decision-making processes, and enabling public access to information for oversight. Independent anti-corruption organizations and third-party monitoring also play an important role. At the international level, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) works to reduce corruption. The United Nations Convention against Corruption, adopted in 2003 and now ratified by over 190 states parties as of 2025, remains the only legally binding universal anti-corruption treaty.
