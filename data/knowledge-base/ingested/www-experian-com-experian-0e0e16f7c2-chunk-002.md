by the sum of all their spending limits (including the limits on cards with no outstanding balances). Balance | Spending limit | Utilization rate (%) | ---|---|---| MasterCard | $1,200 | $4,000 | 30% | ---|---|---|---| VISA | $1,000 | $6,000 | 17% | ---|---|---|---| American Express | $3,000 | $10,000 | 30% | ---|---|---|---| Total | $5,200 | $20,000 | 26% | ---|---|---|---| If you keep your utilization rates at or below 30%â on all accounts in total and on each individual accountâmost experts agree you'll avoid lowering your credit scores. Letting utilization creep higher will depress your score, and approaching 100% can seriously drive down your credit score. Utilization rate is responsible for nearly one-third (30%) of your credit score. Late and missed payments matter a lot. If late or missed payments played a major part in your credit history, you wouldn't have an Exceptional credit score. But keep on mind that no single factor helps your credit score more significantly than prompt payment behavior, and few things can torpedo a near-perfect score quicker than missing a payment. Time is on your side. Length of credit history is responsible for as much as 15% of your credit score.If all other score influences hold constant, a longer credit history will yield a higher credit score than a shorter one. Credit applications and new credit accounts typically have short-term negative effects on your credit score. When you apply for new credit or take on additional debt, credit-scoring systems flag you as being at greater risk of being able to pay your bills. Credit scores drop a small amount when that happens, but typically rebound within a few months, as long as you keep up with all your payments. New credit activity can contribute up to 10% of your overall credit score. Debt composition. The FICOÂ® credit scoring system tends to favor multiple credit accounts, with a mix of revolving credit (accounts such as credit cards that enable you to borrow against a spending limit and make monthly payments of varying amounts) and installment loans (e.g., car loans, mortgages and student loans, with set monthly payments and fixed payback periods). Credit mix is responsible for about 10% of your credit score. When public records appear on your credit report they can have severe negative impacts on your credit score. Entries such as bankruptcies do not appear in every credit report, so they cannot be compared to other credit-score influences in percentage terms, but they can overshadow all other factors and severely lower your credit score. The average mortgage loan amount for consumers with Exceptional credit scores is $246,101. People with FICOÂ® Scores of 803 have an average auto-loan debt of $21,347. Protect your Exceptional credit score People with Exceptional credit scores can be prime targets for identity theft, one of the fastest-growing criminal activities. 85% of identity theft incidents involve fraudulent use of credit cards and account information. A credit score monitoring service is like a home security system for your score. It can alert you if your score starts to slip and, if it starts to dip below the Exceptional range of 800-850, you can act quickly to try to help it recover. An identity theft protection service can alert you if there is suspicious activity detected on your credit report, so you can react before fraudulent activity threatens your Exceptional FICOÂ® Score.
