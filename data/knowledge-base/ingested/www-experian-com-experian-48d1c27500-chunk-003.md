rates and fees. - Budgeting together: If your spouse has a significant amount of debt and you budget together, this could put you on shaky financial ground as a unit. Your partner may not be able to contribute as much to savings or day-to-day expenses if a significant amount of their income goes toward debt payments. - Carrying joint debt: When you take out a loan or a credit card account jointly with your spouse, you're both equally responsible for the payments, even in community property states. If, for instance, one spouse goes on a spending spree with a jointly held credit card, the other is equally on the hook for paying it, even if they weren't aware of the purchase. - Being pursued by creditors: If you live in a community property state and your spouse is facing legal action for personal debts, creditors can often go after joint assets. Remember, other than personal inheritances and debts and assets acquired before marriage, community property states view nearly everything as jointly owned. That means even if your name isn't on the debt in default, both spouses are considered responsible. Say your spouse took out a personal loan in their name alone after marriage and it goes into default: Creditors can come after assets in your name alone if they're legally considered community property. - Myth buster: Are you wondering if your credit report merges with your spouse's when you marry? This is false. In reality, spouses retain their individual credit reports and credit scores after marriage; there's no such thing as a combined credit report. How Does a Prenup Factor In? Couples who live in community property states have greater challenges and liabilities than common-law states when it comes to their spouse's debts and how it impacts them. One potential way to reduce risk is to get a prenuptial agreement before marriage. A prenuptial agreement (or prenup) is an agreement for how your assetsâand your debtsâwould be split up if you decided to dissolve the marriage. This overrides most community property laws and generally allows you to treat your income, assets and debt as separately owned. A prenuptial agreement isn't foolproof: Some creditors can still pursue you for debt taken on by your spouse. That said, it's a helpful way to provide both partners some protection and peace of mind in a community property state. If you live in a common-law state, you have less risk since your spouse's solo debt isn't your responsibility. Your debt will remain yours, and your spouse's theirs, by defaultâyou won't need a prenup to formalize this. That said, you could still decide to use a prenup to manage your individual assets before entering a marriage. Tip: If you're already married, you could still create a postnuptial agreement. It works similar to a prenup, and can help you hammer out how your debts and assets will be split up in the event of divorce or death. Tips for Effectively Managing Debt as a Couple Whatever the laws in your state, if your finances are combined, it may be helpful to think collectively about your debts. After all, your goal is to strengthen your household finances as a whole. Here are some ways to get on the same page. Prioritize good communication. It's easier to manage debt together when you're both clear on what each of you owe, including your balances, rates and due dates. Beyond disclosing your debts, discuss your long-term financial goals. This can help you both focus on and work toward your vision as a team. - Budget together. A budget is key for managing the debt you already have, and for avoiding extra debt in the future. Consider using a budgeting app that allows you to track your income and expenses as a couple. - Agree on how you'll pay off debts.
