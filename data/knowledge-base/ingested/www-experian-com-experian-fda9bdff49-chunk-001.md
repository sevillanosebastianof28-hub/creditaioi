How Do I Get a Paid Collection off My Credit Report? Quick Answer Even after you pay a collection account, it stays on your credit report for seven years. However, you can dispute collection accounts that are inaccurate. You may even be able to persuade a collection agency to remove the account once youâve paid it. Although paying off accounts in collections is generally a good idea, it won't immediately wipe the collection account from your credit report. Even if you pay it, a collection account stays on your credit report for seven years from the date you first missed a payment. However, once you pay off the debt, it will show as paid when your credit report is updatedâtypically within 30 days of you making the payment. Paid collection accounts typically have less negative impact on your credit score than unpaid ones. Do I Need to Notify the Credit Bureaus of Paid Collections? No, you don't need to notify the credit bureaus of paid collections. Once you pay off the debt, the collection agency should alert the three major consumer credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax), which will update their records. Updating records typically takes a month or so; at that point, the collection account's status should change to "paid." However, it will still take seven years from the date your account first became delinquent for the paid collection account to come off your credit report. If you had extenuating circumstances that led to a delinquent payment, you can request what's called a goodwill deletion. Call or write to the collection agency asking to have the account deleted as a gesture of goodwill. The collection agency doesn't have to comply, but there's no harm in asking. You may have better luck getting a goodwill deletion if you have a history of on-time payments to the original creditor. When requesting a goodwill deletion, emphasize your otherwise positive credit history and explain any unusual circumstances behind the missed payments, such as a lengthy illness, job loss or natural disaster. How Do Collections Affect Credit? The impact of collections on your credit varies depending on the type of debt involved and the credit scoring model a lender uses. For example, the most recent versions of the FICOÂ® ScoreÎ (FICOÂ® Scores 9, 10 and 10 T) and the VantageScoreÂ® (versions 3.0 and 4.0) disregard all paid collections. Whether paid or unpaid, medical collections under $500 won't appear on your credit report or impact your credit score. Unpaid medical collections balances of $500 or more may negatively affect your credit score. However, FICOÂ® Scores 9 and 10 lower your scores less for these unpaid medical collections than for non-medical debt. Although the impact of unpaid collections is reduced in newer credit scoring models, many lenders still use older credit scoring models that take paid collections into account. For example, credit card issuers frequently use FICOÂ® Score 8, which lowers your score if you have paid or unpaid collections of $100 or more. Many mortgage lenders use FICOÂ® Score 2, FICOÂ® Score 4 or FICOÂ® Score 5. It's impossible to know in advance which credit scoring models lenders may use when you apply for credit. You can minimize the negative impact of non-medical collection accounts over $100 or medical collection accounts over $500 by paying off the debt.

Whether you pay them or not, collection accounts are removed from your credit report seven years from the date your debt to the original creditor first became delinquent. Generally, creditors report your missed payment to the credit bureaus after one billing cycle (usually 30 days) passes without a payment. When the creditor gives up on collecting from youâtypically after 120 days without paymentâthey may sell your debt to a collection agency. If that
