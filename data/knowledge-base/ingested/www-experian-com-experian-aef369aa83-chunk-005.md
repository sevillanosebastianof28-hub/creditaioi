goals faster by making more money. Request extra hours at work, apply for a promotion or better-paying job, or ask your boss for a raise. If your schedule allows, consider getting a part-time job or starting a side hustle. There are plenty of options, including tutoring, childcare, walking dogs, delivering food, rideshare driving, selling things online and more. 23. Cut Your Transportation Costs Can you work from home a few days a week, or commute via public transportation, carpooling, bicycling, walking or ride-sharing? If so, you could save hundreds of dollars per month compared to driving your car. Some employers even offer stipends or reimbursements for employees who choose greener transportation options. If these options won't work for your daily commute, perhaps you can walk, bike or ride a bus to appointments or errands. Driving fewer miles per year could qualify you for low-mileage car insurance discounts too. 24. Trim Your Housing Expenses Whether you rent or own, housing is most people's biggest expense. You may be able to reduce the cost of housing by taking in a roommate or renting out a room in your home. It's sometimes possible to negotiate your lease terms to lower your rent. Downsizing your home could reduce not only your mortgage, but also the cost of utilities, home insurance and maintenance. Just be sure to consider moving costs, real estate agent fees and potential tax implications. Learn more: Financial Pros and Cons of Downsizing Your Home 25. Find Free or Low-Cost Fun Keep saving from being boring by searching out free or inexpensive activities. Go for a hike, take a picnic to the park or visit the community pool. Check out fun activities your local library has to offer, such as movie rentals, children's story hours and crafts classes. Museums, zoos and other institutions typically have free or discounted entry one day per month or one evening per week. 26. Swap With Friends and Family Get more without spending more by sharing with friends and family instead of buying things. Organize a regular swap where neighbors share items they're willing to lend out or give away. Toys, games, books, clothing, gardening equipment, household items, sporting goods or tools are all fair game. You can either keep what you take or bring items back to the next swap for someone else to use. Frequently Asked Questions The Bottom Line Another way to save money: Maintain a good credit score. Good credit can help you qualify for lower interest rates on credit cards and loans, reducing the cost of borrowing money. You can check your credit score and credit report for free to see where you stand. If your credit score isn't where you want it, paying down debt, keeping credit utilization low and paying your bills on time can help improve it, which could make it easier to reach your savings goals.
