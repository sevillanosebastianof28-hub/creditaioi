Add-Ons Your car insurance could come with extras you aren't even aware you're paying for. Review your policy, looking for add-ons you may not need. These may include: Rental reimbursement coverage that pays for a rental car while your vehicle is being repaired for a covered loss - Windshield replacement coverage that repairs or replaces windows and windshields with a low deductible or no deductible - New-car replacement insurance that replaces a car totaled within a certain number of years or miles with an equivalent new car - Roadside assistance coverage if your car breaks down on the road - Some add-on coverage may be worth keeping, depending on your needs. For example, if you don't belong to another roadside assistance program, you may want this coverage. 6. Consider Usage-Based Insurance Since driving less often means you're less likely to have an accident, usage-based auto insurance offers lower rates to customers who drive less than the average. You may qualify if you drive under 12,000 miles annually, although each insurer sets its own standard. Low-mileage insurance requires reporting your odometer reading regularly or, in some cases, installing a tracking device in your car. A related option, pay-per-mile insurance, charges a base premium per month plus a per-mile assessment for each mile you drive. 7. Choose the Right Vehicle Buying a new car and hoping to keep your insurance down? You might get a discount just for having a new car, or you could save even more by choosing a certain type of car. For example, some insurance carriers offer lower premiums for alternative-fuel vehicles, including electric cars and hybrids. You might also save by opting for a car with factory-installed anti-theft devices or safety features such as alarms, tracking systems, air bags or anti-lock brakes. For example, Geico says an air bag can save you up to 23%. 8. Bundle Your Policies Insuring more than one vehicle with the same insurance company generally reduces your premiums. You'll also typically get a discount if you purchase multiple types of insurance from the same carrier. This practice, such as buying homeowners, renters or life insurance along with your auto insurance, is called bundling. 9. Improve Your Credit Most states allow the use of credit-based insurance scores when setting auto insurance premiums. Unless you live in California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon or Utah, insurers may check this credit score to estimate your likelihood of filing a claim. Credit-based insurance scores are calculated using information from your credit report. Although you can't easily check your credit-based insurance score, checking your regular credit score can give you a good idea of where you stand. Review your credit report to ensure it's up to date and take steps to improve your credit score, such as paying bills on time and bringing late accounts current. These moves can also help boost your credit-based insurance score, which might mean paying less for car insurance. The Bottom Line Paying car insurance premiums will probably never be your favorite activity, but following the steps above can ease a bit of the sting. Evaluate your car insurance needs, assess your budget and consider which ways to save might work for you. Donât overpay for auto insurance If youâre looking for ways to cut back on monthly costs, it could be a good idea to see if you can save on your auto insurance.
