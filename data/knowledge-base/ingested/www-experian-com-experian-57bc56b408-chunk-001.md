How Long Does an Accident Stay on Your Insurance? Quick Answer Although your complete driving history holds a lot of weight, insurance carriers will look at the last three to five years of your driving record when calculating your rates. The exact length of time can vary by state and insurance company.Car insurance companies consider multiple factors when determining your rates, including your driving record. Your history as a driver holds a lot of weight, as it helps insurers assess risk and better understand how likely you are to file a future claim. If you have a recent auto accident on your driving record, it's something that could translate to higher ratesâespecially if it's accompanied by moving violations, such as speeding tickets. The silver lining is that an accident's impact on your premiums isn't permanent. Many insurance companies only consider the last three to five years of your driving record when calculating your rates, although the exact length of time can vary by state and insurance company. To be clear, that doesn't necessarily mean that a previous accident will be removed from your driving record after a period of timeâit's just to say that insurers typically won't factor it into your rates. In other words, an accident from six years ago might still be on your driving record, but it might not have a huge impact on your car insurance ratesâassuming you've continued to demonstrate responsible driving since then. It is best to compare auto insurance rates from different companies when you're ready to switch car insurance carriers. Wondering how long an accident will stay on your insurance? Let's first unpack how it affects your car insurance rates in the short term. What Happens to Your Insurance Rates After an Accident? Since your driving record influences your car insurance premiums, an accident could bump up your insurance costs. However, it doesn't mean that your rates will definitely skyrocket if you're involved in an accident. In some cases, they may not change at all if you weren't at fault or if it's your first accident. You're likely to see a rate hike if you've been involved in other accidents over the past few years. And, again, the same goes for moving violations. Insurers look at the big picture when determining your risk profile and, in turn, your rates. In this way, accidents and citations can stack on top of each other to increase your premium. Your rates could also go up after an accident if the other driver doesn't have enough insurance to cover the damage. In this situation, you might have to utilize your own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, which could trigger a rate increase. It's also helpful to think in terms of individual claims. A minor fender bender will likely result in a smaller claim when compared to a collision that causes serious damage or injuries. Let's say you get into an accident that's primarily your fault. If you file a claim with your insurance company that exceeds a specific amount, your premium will spike by a correlating percentage, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The correlation varies from insurer to insurer, and you can expect that rate hike to be there as long as your insurer considers the accident as a factor in your rate.

In some cases, an accident could result in your car being totaled, which is when the overall cost of repairs outweighs the value of the car. At that point, your insurer may provide a payout equivalent to your car's actual cash value. The value of a vehicle is typically determined by the vehicle's make and model, age, mileage and condition, among other factors, at the time of the accident. It's essentially a rough estimate of how much the car could have reasonably
