In conjunction with its law enforcement and advocacy work, the FTC provides guidance about the application of the U.S. antitrust laws to promote transparency and encourage compliance with the law. These resources aid antitrust practitioners, policy makers, businesses, and consumers with questions about the antitrust laws or competition policy. Core competition documents have been developed with the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division to promote sound U.S. competition policy. This site also contains links to Advisory Opinions, which provide guidance concerning proposed conduct. The Bureau of Competition has developed educational resources aimed at consumers and businesses to prevent consumer injury, increase business compliance and augment its enforcement efforts.
