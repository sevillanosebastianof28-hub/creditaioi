good to excellent credit scores, and they won't be options for everyone. Rewards cards that only require poor or fair credit are available, but they tend to offer lower rewards rates and fewer benefits, and may have higher APRs. You could use one of these to help build your credit and then apply for a premium card once you're ready. Unexpected Devaluations or Lost Rewards Points and miles rewards programs can experience unexpected devaluation, such as when an airline changes a redemption requirement from 20,000 to 25,000 miles for a flight. Some rewards can also expire. Even if your rewards don't expire, credit card issuers can take back rewards if they decide you're gaming their rewards program or when they close your card.

Paying your monthly bill on time and only using a small portion of your available credit can help you build credit. If you use a large portion of your credit limit, paying down the balance before the end of your statement period might help you maintain a low credit utilization rate, which can help your scores. Missing payments and having a high credit utilization rateâeven if you pay your monthly bill in fullâcan hurt your credit scores. You may also see a small credit score drop when you open a card because applying can lead to a hard inquiry, and the new account will lower the average age of your credit accounts. But, if you manage your accounts well, your scores will tend to improve over time. Should You Get a Rewards Credit Card? Although rewards cards aren't a good fit for everyone, you could consider getting a rewards credit card if: You'll use the card for everyday purchases that you were going to make anyway. - You can generally afford to pay off your credit card bill in full each month. - You only get a rewards card with an annual fee if the benefits outweigh the cost. - You learn to understand how the program works, what transactions earn rewards, when rewards might expire and the best redemption options. - If you don't want to get a credit card that's OK too. You can still build your credit without a credit card and try to get a personal loan if you need to borrow money for an emergency. What to Look for in a Rewards Credit Card Card issuers often offer multiple types of rewards credit cards with different fees and rewards structures. If it seems like a rewards card is a good fit, the real question may be which rewards card to get. You can compare the options to see which might work best based on where you'll use the card, how much you'll spend, what types of rewards you want and how much time you want to spend researching the rewards program. Additionally, rewards cards with the highest rewards and most benefits usually have an annual fee. Consider whether a higher rewards rate or extra cardholder benefits are worth the cost, or if you'd prefer a rewards card with no annual fee instead.
