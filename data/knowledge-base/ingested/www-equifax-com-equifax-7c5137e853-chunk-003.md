will face closing costs. Since home equity loans are considered a second mortgage, there may be hefty closing costs and other fees involved, just like with your primary mortgage. These costs, which typically range from 2% to 5% of the total loan amount, can add up, making the entire process expensive. - Another option: a home equity line of credit (HELOC) What is a HELOC Loan? A HELOC, though also secured by your home, works differently than a home equity loan. In this type of financing, a homeowner applies for an open line of credit and then can borrow up to a fixed amount on an as-needed basis. You only pay interest on the amount borrowed. Typically, a HELOC will remain open for a set term, perhaps 10 years. Then the draw period will end, and the loan will be amortized—which means you begin making set monthly payments—for perhaps 20 years. The main benefit of a HELOC is that you only pay interest on what you borrow. Say you need $35,000 over three years to pay for a child's college education. With a HELOC, your interest payments would gradually increase as your loan balance grows. If you had instead taken out a lump-sum loan for the same amount, you would have been paying interest on the entire $35,000 from day one. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) requirements The application process for a HELOC is similar to that of a home equity loan. Lenders aim to evaluate the total market value of your home. Then, they will thoroughly review your financial history to determine if you're qualified to take on the new line of credit. As with a home equity loan, lenders may consider the following factors when evaluating your application: Home equity. It's important to have equity built in your home before applying for a HELOC. The total amount you can borrow will depend on the amount of equity you've built over time. - Debt-to-income ratio. Lenders will review your total income and the amount of debt you're already balancing. You may be asked to submit proof of employment or other income statements for review. - Credit history. Your credit history will also play an important role in the approval process by offering lenders the ability to check your experience borrowing and paying off debt. Potential lenders and creditors may accept or deny your loan application based, in part, on information in your credit reports. It's a good idea to regularly review your credit reports to make sure the information is accurate and complete. Once the lender completes their review and approves you for the new line of credit, you may be offered a credit card or checks for the account related to your HELOC. Be sure to review the terms of your agreement carefully. The repayment conditions and timeline will vary from lender to lender.

HELOC vs. Second Mortgage Choosing the right home equity financing depends entirely on your unique situation. Typically, HELOCs will have lower interest rates and greater payment flexibility, but if you need all the money at once, a home equity loan is better. If you are trying to decide, think about the purpose of the financing. Are you borrowing so you'll have funds available as spending needs arise over time, or do you need a lump sum now to pay for something like a kitchen renovation? A home equity loan offers borrowers a lump sum with an interest rate that is fixed, but tends to be higher. HELOCs, on the other
