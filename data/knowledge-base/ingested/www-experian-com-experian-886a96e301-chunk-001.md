Bankruptcy: How It Works, Types and Consequences Quick Answer Bankruptcy can provide financial relief in the form of a restructured debt repayment plan or a liquidation of certain assets to pay off a portion of your debt. Although bankruptcy may be unavoidable for some, it can severely damage your credit score, so it's crucial to pursue all alternatives before considering it. Bankruptcy is a legal process that eliminates all or part of your debt, though not without serious consequences. Understanding the bankruptcy process, including the different options and their ramifications, can help you determine whether the benefits are worth the drawbacks. Here's what you need to know about how bankruptcy works and what it takes to rebuild your credit afterward, as well as some alternatives to consider first. How Does Bankruptcy Work? Bankruptcy is a legal process designed to help consumers obtain relief from debt they can't afford to repay while also ensuring that creditors receive some payment based on the borrower's financial situation and assets. Once you file for bankruptcy, your creditors must halt all collection attempts, including things like foreclosure, repossession and wage garnishment. That said, only certain types of debt can be included in bankruptcyâmore on that in a minute. Depending on which type of bankruptcy you chooseâChapter 7 or Chapter 13âyou may need to repay a portion of what you owe based on your financial situation and assets. All remaining debt will be discharged, meaning you no longer have an obligation to pay itâand creditors can no longer attempt to collect. Although you can technically file for bankruptcy on your own, it often makes sense to enlist the help of a bankruptcy attorney who can help you determine which type of bankruptcy is right for you, guide you through the process and act as your representative in the proceedings. What Is Chapter 7 Bankruptcy? Chapter 7 bankruptcy, also known as straight or liquidation bankruptcy, involves selling off some of your assets to pay off what you can and discharging the rest of your debts. The court assigns a trustee to your case who will manage the liquidation of your assets and pay your creditors with the proceeds. Certain assets are exempt, but the types and amounts can vary by state. From start to finish, the process typically takes between four and six months. Keep in mind, though, that not everyone qualifies for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. You'll need to pass a means test or meet certain criteria for low income, among other prerequisites. What Is Chapter 13 Bankruptcy? Also known as reorganization bankruptcy, Chapter 13 bankruptcy will restructure your debts in a way that allows you to pay off a portion of what you oweâor possibly all of itâover a period of three to five years. You'll propose a monthly payment amount based on your financial situation, which your creditors can accept or object toâat which point, you may need to negotiate. In exchange for a longer process, Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows you to keep your assets. There's also no means test requirement to take advantage of this option, and the length of your restructured repayment term will depend on your income level. However, you will need to complete certain other requirements before you file. Key Bankruptcy Terms to Know Throughout the bankruptcy process, you'll likely come across some legal terms that may not be familiar to you. Here are some of the most common and important ones to know: 341 meeting: Also known as the meeting of creditors, you'll be questioned under oath by your creditors or the trustee about your financial situation. - Credit counseling: Before you can file for bankruptcy, you'll need to undergo individual or group credit counseling. You'll also be required to take a personal finance management course before your bankruptcy can be discharged. However, there are situations where one or both
