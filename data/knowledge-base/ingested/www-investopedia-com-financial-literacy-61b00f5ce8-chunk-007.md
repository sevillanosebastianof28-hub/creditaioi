in lower-cost loans for more borrowers with less risk to the lender. In practice, that means it accepts borrowers with credit scores as low as 300. Moreover, students and college graduates with an income can qualify without a credit history. Pros & Cons Pros Low minimum credit score Fast funding A wide range of loan amounts Cons Potentially high origination fee High APRs for some borrowers Fewer loan term options than competitors Overview If your credit score is below 580, you don’t have many options to borrow. Loan offers you do receive will be expensive, with high origination fees and APRs. Upstart’s minimum required credit score of 300 is the lowest of the 59 lenders in our database. It will even consider borrowers without a credit score. Despite this flexibility, its rates, fees, and terms are not prohibitively expensive. Upstart works with various lenders with different underwriting requirements, so borrowers with weaker or stronger credit profiles will match with lenders offering rates and terms that fit. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $75,000, covering a range of borrower needs. Rates start at 6.70% and max out at 35.99%, the industry's de facto APR cap. (That rate cap is linked to the Military Lending Act, which limits APRs on consumer loans for military service members at 36%.) Upstart has made available nearly $40 billion in credit of various types through its platform, including personal loans, since it was founded in 2012. The fintech lender is headquartered in San Mateo, Calif.

The bank’s maximum advertised APR is low, and existing Citibank customers are eligible for same-day funding. Plus, you can get in-person help with your application at a local branch. Pros & Cons Pros Low maximum APR No fees of any kind Repayment terms up to 5 years High J.D. Power ranking Cons High starting APRs Lower loan limits than other lenders Must be an existing Citibank customer Overview Citibank doesn’t charge origination fees or late fees, and its maximum advertised APR is low, keeping borrowing costs down. The autopay discount of 0.50% is higher than many other lenders offer (0.25% is typical). Citigold and Citi Priority customers can get an additional 0.25% rate discount. Another perk for existing customers is same-day funding, which is sent directly to their Citibank account. In the 2024 J.D. Power Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study, Citibank ranked third. With all that in its favor, it’s disappointing that Citibank now limits personal loan applications to existing customers. Citibank, founded in 1812, is the third-largest U.S. bank, with total assets exceeding $1.83 trillion, as of September 2025. It operates 648 branches in the U.S. In a $70 billion deal, Citicorp and Travelers Group merged in 1998 to form Citigroup.
