Average Savings by Age: How Americans Compare Quick Answer The average savings balance for people ages 64 and younger ranged from $5,400 to $8,700, according to data from the Federal Reserve. What does the average person your age have in savings? The answer won't tell you much about your own financial security, but knowing what others have in the bank might give you an indication of whether you're keeping up or falling behind. According to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) for 2022 (the most recent study released publicly), the average savings balance for people ages 64 and younger ranged from $20,540 to $72,520, with median balances ranging from $5,400 to $8,700. Here's what each of four major age groups have in savings, along with some guidelines for retirement savings by age, tips on saving more and suggestions on where to keep your money. Average Savings by Age The Federal Reserve tracks balances by age for transaction accounts, which include checking, savings, money market and brokerage cash accounts, as well as prepaid debit cards. While some of these balances aren't held in designated savings accounts, they do represent cash on hand. We'll look at both the median and mean (average) transaction account balances from the Fed's data. Mean account balances are an average of all balances used in the survey divided by the number of accounts. However, because the data used in the SCF is weighted to include super-wealthy households, the statistical average may be skewed. For comparison, we'll also include median balances to get a sense of where the midpoint between the highest and lowest balances lies. According to the Fed report, median values may be more representative than averages of typical account balances for each group. Here's what the Fed's Survey of Consumer Finances reports about savings by age. Savings by Age 34 Average transaction account balance: $20,540 Median transaction account balance: $5,400 Early adulthood is full of financial challengesâgetting through school, launching a career, starting a life and paying down student loan debt, to name a few. The standard advice is to save at least three to six months' worth of expenses in an emergency fund. The reality: $5,400 is the median checking and savings balance and $20,540 is the average for people under age 35. How to Save Money Under 35 Although entry-level wages are generally low and young people have many competing uses for their money, these practices can help get you off to a good start: Start a savings habit. A 2024 Bank of America survey found that only 15% of Generation Z (ages 18 to 27) are setting aside a portion of their income in savings, and only one in five are saving for retirement.
