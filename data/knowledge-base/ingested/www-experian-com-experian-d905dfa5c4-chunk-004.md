to see whether your budget is working. You can track spending on paper or with a spreadsheet, but the easiest option is to download a budgeting app that automatically syncs to your bank account. That way, you can import and categorize transactions and chart your progress over time. Learn more: How to Track Your Expenses 6. Adjust Your Budget as Needed Regularly review your spending and compare it to your budget. You can do this each month, each pay period or each week, whichever works best for you. If you miss the marks you set for yourself, don't beat yourself up. Instead, look for ways to adjust your spending to fit your budget. For instance, maybe you can eat out less and cook at home more often, or cancel some streaming services. If you're going over budget month after month, though, you may need to set more realistic savings goals or bring in more income.

Refocus on your goals. Why did you create a budget in the first place? Maybe you want to pay off debt, buy a home or hold your dream wedding. Picturing yourself achieving these goals can reignite your motivation. - Build in some wiggle room. If you're consistently struggling to stick to your budget, your spending plan may be unrealistically strict. An overly restrictive budget can backfire, causing burnout. A budget that allows flexibility is more likely to keep you on track. - Celebrate small wins. Meaningful change isn't always easy. Stay inspired by setting small goals (such as sticking to your entertainment budget for the week) and celebrating progress with no-splurge treats. - Automate savings and bill payments. Automation helps remove temptation. If you never see this money, you're less likely to spend it on non-necessities. - Prepare for recurring expenses. It's easy for recurring occasional expenses, such as tuition or property taxes, to slip your mind when making a budget. Build them into your spending plan and set up sinking funds to save for them. - Buddy up. An accountability partner can help keep you on track. If you don't have a friend or partner to keep you accountable, join a financial accountability group or try an accountability app. - Learn more: How to Stop Impulse Spending Frequently Asked Questions The Bottom Line There's a bit of a learning curve when you first make a budget, but eventually, living within your means should become second nature.
