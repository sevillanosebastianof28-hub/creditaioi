and substance. Information will be presented within its proper context. Where appropriate, data will be accompanied by full, accurate, and transparent documentation, and will disclose error sources affecting its quality. Analytic results will be generated using sound statistical and research methods. - Integrity: The Bureau will protect information from unauthorized access or revision, to prevent corruption or falsification of information. The Bureau will comply with government-wide security requirements when disseminating information. - The Bureau will strive to ensure that statistical and financial data disseminated by the Bureau is capable of being substantially reproduced by an independent evaluator, subject to some degree of imprecision. The Bureau will also provide the sources, methods, procedures, references, and assumptions employed to create information disseminated by the Bureau. When used regarding financial or statistical information, a characterization of “influential” generally means the Bureau determines that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions. Organizational components of the Bureau shall develop appropriate definitions of what constitutes “influential” information as they develop processes for dissemination. When information is determined by an organization component to be “influential,” an added level of scrutiny will be applied, including an assurance that the information is reproducible. Purpose The Bureau has drafted the following guidelines to promulgate its quality standards and formalize its correction mechanism. The policies and procedures strive to ensure that the quality of information and data released to the public is accurate and appropriate and meets the Bureau’s internal definitions of utility, objectivity, and integrity. This guidance should be used to ensure and maximize the quality of information disseminated by the Bureau. The Bureau’s guidelines are based on the OMB guidelines. The guidelines are not intended to be legally binding regulations or mandates. They are not legally enforceable and do not create any legal rights or impose any legally binding requirements or obligations on the Bureau or the public. Nothing in these guidelines affects any otherwise available judicial review of agency action. Scope The Bureau guidelines are effective upon publication. The guidelines cover information disseminated on or after publication of the guidelines, regardless of when the information was first disseminated. Organizational components should use these guidelines to develop processes for disseminating quality information. The guidelines apply to information disseminated to the public in any medium, including textual, graphic, narrative, numerical, or audiovisual forms. The guidelines apply to information that the Bureau posts on the internet. The guidelines also apply to Bureau-sponsored distribution of information – that is, any information distributed by a third party at the direction of the Bureau or information the Bureau has the authority to review and approve prior to release. The guidelines do not extend to Bureau interpretations of data and information. The guidelines do not override other compelling interests such as privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other confidentiality protections. The guidelines do not apply to hyperlinks to information disseminated by others. The guidelines do not apply to opinions where the Bureau’s presentation makes it clear that the material is an opinion or the Bureau’s views rather than fact. In addition, the guidelines do not apply to information disseminated in the following contexts: Dissemination of information limited to government employees or agency contractors or grantees; - Dissemination of information intended to be limited to intra-or inter-agency use or sharing of government information; - Correspondence with individual persons, archival records, public filings, subpoenas or adjudicative processes; - Response to requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, or other similar laws. - Process Information review Information quality is integral to every step of the development of information, from its creation through its collection, maintenance, and dissemination. Organizational components of Bureau are expected to develop processes for reviewing the quality, including the objectivity, utility, and integrity, of information before
