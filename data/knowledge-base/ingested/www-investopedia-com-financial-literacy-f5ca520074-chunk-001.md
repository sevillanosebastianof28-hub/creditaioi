Learn about our Financial Review Board Close The concept of spreading risk, central to insurance, dates back nearly 4,000 years to the Code of Hammurabi, which established early principles of shared financial responsibility. Over time, this idea evolved through many forms, from medieval guilds that supported members in times of loss to the rise of maritime insurance in the 1600s as global trade expanded. Landmark developments such as the Great Fire of London spurred the creation of fire and life insurance in England, while Blaise Pascal's work on probability laid the foundation for modern risk assessment. Together, these milestones shaped the insurance industry as we know it today, a system built to manage uncertainty and protect against loss.

Early Insurance Practices: The Code of Hammurabi The concept of insurance dates back to around 1750 B.C. with the Code of Hammurabi, which Babylonians carved into a stone monument and several clay tablets. The code describes a form of bottomry, whereby a ship’s cargo could be pledged in exchange for a loan. Repayment of the loan was contingent on a successful voyage, and the debtor did not have to repay the loan if the ship was lost at sea. Insurance Evolution: From Guilds to Group Coverage In the Middle Ages, most craftsmen were trained through the guild system. Apprentices spent their childhoods working for masters for little or no pay. Once they became masters themselves, they paid dues to the guild and trained their own apprentices. The wealthier guilds had large coffers that acted as a type of insurance fund. If a master's practice burned down—a common occurrence in the largely wooden cities of medieval Europe—the guild would rebuild it using money from its own funds. If a master was robbed, the guild would cover their obligations until money started to flow in again. If a master was suddenly disabled or killed, the guild would support them or their surviving family. This safety net encouraged more people to leave farming to take up trades. As a result, the amount of goods available for trade increased, as did the range of goods and services. The basic style of insurance used by guilds is still around today in the form of group coverage. Maritime Insurance: Managing Risk Across the Seas In the late 1600s, shipping was just beginning between the New World and the Old, as colonies were being established and exotic goods were ferried back. The practice of underwriting emerged in the same London coffeehouses that operated as the unofficial stock exchange for the British Empire. A coffeehouse owned by Edward Lloyd, later of Lloyd's
