How to Protect Yourself from Social Security Number Identity Theft Highlights: A stolen Social Security number is one of the leading causes of identity theft and can threaten your financial health. - It’s important to keep your Social Security number to yourself whenever possible and avoid carrying your physical card with you. - Although there’s no way to totally prevent identity theft if your Social Security number is stolen, certain strategies can help lessen your risk. - Imagine you open your mail to find a credit card bill with thousands of dollars of mysterious charges. Or you get a call from a lender threatening repossession of a luxury car that you don’t own. As alarming as these scenarios may seem, they are signs of a surprisingly common crime — identity theft. A stolen Social Security number (SSN) is one of the leading causes of identity theft and can be a real threat to your financial health. Avoid this scam’s frustrating legal and financial consequences and learn how to better protect your personal information from Social Security number identity theft. Warning signs of Social Security number identity theft Social Security number identity theft occurs when someone gains unauthorized access to your SSN. For example, a scammer might steal your wallet, purse or mail, rummage through your trash or pose as an employer, government agency or someone else who legitimately needs your personal information. Being able to spot signs of potential Social Security number identity theft is the first step toward keeping your information safe. These are some of the most common ways that your SSN might be compromised and the warning signs to look out for. Social Security card loss or theft. If your Social Security card is nowhere to be found, or if your purse, wallet or other personal belongings have been stolen, you may be vulnerable to identity theft. If you know your SSN by heart, it may not be necessary to get a new card, but you can easily order a free replacement from the Social Security Administration. Following a loss or theft, you should keep a close eye on your credit reports, as these can be your first indication of identity theft. The three nationwide consumer reporting agencies - Equifax®, TransUnion® and Experian® - offer fraud alerts and security freezes, which can all be activated to help better protect against fraudulent credit or loan applications. You can create a myEquifax account to place a fraud alert and security freeze on your Equifax credit report. Learn more about fraud alerts, security freezes and credit report locks here. Phishing and smishing. Phishing scams attempt to deceive you into providing personal information through deceptive emails, while smishing scams do the same with deceptive text messages. Scammers may attempt to trick you into giving up your SSN or following a hyperlink that downloads malware onto your device. Malware is harmful software that can monitor your keystrokes, redirect you to dangerous websites and create pop-ups, stealing identifying information about you in the process. It’s easy to believe you’d never fall for these scams. However, phishing and smishing campaigns can be very sophisticated, appear legitimate and often involve something called spoofing. Spoofing is when an attacker creates a replica of the official website, email address or phone number of a trusted source, such as a bank, government agency or retail company. Sometimes the fraudulent website or email address will differ from the original by a single character. If you find yourself with an influx of emails or texts from unknown senders, it could be a sign you are being targeted for your personal information. Phone and texting scams. You may also receive robocalls or spam texts from identity thieves. Many use spoofing to imitate local area codes, government agencies, retail companies, banks or other trusted entities.
