high APY that I could ladder. I checked out a few of the options on our list and decided to go with CIT Bank and Bread Savings, because applying for the CDs online was really easy, and they offered mobile apps—I’m one of those people who checks their financial accounts frequently, if not daily. I’d keep accounts with both of them (assuming the rates are good when the two terms end). What Do You Need to Open One of the Best CDs? To open a CD, you'll need some personal information including, but not limited to: NameAddressPhone number For example, the bank's customer service team may ask you to provide a copy of your license or ID if you don't have an account with that institution already. When you have that info handy, fill out the application for your CD account: State how you'll fund the CD, whether via an electronic transfer or another method.Fund the CD.State how you want to receive the interest, all at the end or in monthly installments (if required). Once you've done all that, you should officially have a CD in your name, though check with the institution to ensure you've taken all the right steps. Financial Advisor Insight "Look for the best CD rates and consider laddering the term of the renewals, whenever possible to hedge for potential liquidity needs in the future and not miss opportunities to lock in potential higher rates," said Sibyl Slade, a member of Investopedia’s Financial Advisor Council. How to Build a CD Ladder Smart CD investors have a specific tactic for hedging against rate changes over time and maximizing their return. It's called a CD ladder and it enables you to access the higher rates typically offered on 5-year CDs, but with the twist that a portion of your money becomes available every year, rather than every five years. Here's how to do it. Take the amount of money you want to invest in CDs and divide it by five.Put one-fifth of the funds into a top-earning 1-year CD, another fifth into a top 2-year CD, another into a 3-year CD, and so forth through a 5-year CD. Let’s say you have $25,000 available. That would give you five CDs of varying lengths, each with a value of $5,000.When the first CD matures in a year, you take the resulting funds and open a top-rate 5-year CD.One year later, your initial 2-year CD will mature, and you'll invest those funds into another 5-year CD.Continue doing this every year with whichever CD is maturing until you end up with a portfolio of five CDs all earning 5-year APYs, but with one of them maturing every 12 months, keeping your money a bit more accessible than if all of it were locked up for a full five years. What Happens if I Withdraw From a CD Early? If you withdraw money early from a CD, you'll likely have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. This is usually a certain number of months' worth of interest that you earned in the CD thus far. For example, if you had deposited $10,000 in a 12-month CD with a rate of 5.00%, and withdrew it early, you might have to pay three months' worth of the interest you had earned. So instead of cashing out $500 at the end of the CD term, you'd walk away with less interest earned, the exact amount depending on how early you withdrew the money. Now, not all CDs have early withdrawal penalties. Some no-penalty CDs are available and have more flexibility, However, they may also come with lower interest rates. How Are CDs Taxed? Just like how the interest you earn on any money you have in savings, money market, and checking accounts is taxable as interest income at both the state and federal levels, the
