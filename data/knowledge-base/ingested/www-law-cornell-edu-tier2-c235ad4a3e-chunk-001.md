Support Access to Free Law If everyone reading today donated the price of their morning cup of coffee, we would meet our fundraising goal for the entire campaign. Support Access to Free Law If everyone reading today donated the price of their morning cup of coffee, we would meet our fundraising goal for the entire campaign. Over 40 million people rely on the Legal Information Institute [LII] each year to find and understand the laws that govern them. Your one-time or monthly gift will directly support the small staff and computing facilities we require to make law free and open for everyone. On behalf of all those who wish to know their rights and responsibilities under the law, thanks for your support!
