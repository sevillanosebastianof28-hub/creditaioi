consider other communications concerning a pending or impending matter that are made outside the presence of the parties or their lawyers. If a Justice receives an unauthorized ex parte communication bearing on the substance of the matter, the Justice should promptly notify the parties of the subject matter of the communication and allow the parties to respond. A Justice should not knowingly make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court. The prohibition on public comment on the merits of a matter does not extend to public statements made in the course of the Justice’s official duties. For scholarly, informational, or educational purposes, a Justice may describe the issues in a pending or impending case. A Justice should require similar restraint by Court personnel subject to the Justice’s control. A Justice should not direct Court personnel to engage in conduct on the Justice’s behalf or as the Justice’s representative when that conduct would contravene the Canons if undertaken by the Justice. B. Disqualification. (1) A Justice is presumed impartial and has an obligation to sit unless disqualified. (2) A Justice should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the Justice’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, that is, where an unbiased and reasonable person who is aware of all relevant circumstances would doubt that the Justice could fairly discharge his or her duties. Such instances include, but are not limited to, those in which: (a) The Justice has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding; (b) At a prior stage of the proceeding, the Justice represented a party, or a lawyer with whom the Justice previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer for a party, or the Justice or lawyer has been a material witness in the proceeding; (c) The Justice knows that the Justice, individually or as a fiduciary, or the Justice’s spouse or minor child residing in the Justice’s household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be affected substantially by the outcome of the proceeding; (d) The Justice or the Justice’s spouse, or a person related to either within the third degree of relationship, or the spouse of such person, is known by the Justice: (i) to be a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party; (ii) to be acting as a lawyer in the proceeding; (iii) to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding; or (iv) likely to be a material witness in the proceeding. (e) The Justice has served in government employment and in that capacity participated as a judge (in a previous judicial position), counsel, advisor, or material witness concerning the proceeding or has expressed during prior government or judicial service an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy. (f) The Justice’s spouse or a person related to the Justice or the Justice’s spouse within the third degree of relationship, or the spouse of such person, is known by the Justice: (i) to have served as lead counsel for a party below; or (ii) to be an equity partner in a law firm that appears before the Court on behalf of a party to the proceeding and the Court has not received written assurance that the income from Supreme Court litigation is permanently excluded from the person’s compensation. (3) The rule of necessity may override the rule of disqualification. (4) Neither the filing of a brief amicus curiae nor the participation of counsel for amicus curiae requires a Justice’s disqualification.
