report for up to seven years. If you're late but not yet 30 days behind on a payment, pay it immediately. If the payment is already 30 or more days overdue, bring the account current as soon as possible. A payment that's 60, 90 or 120 days late will hurt your credit score more than one that's 30 days late. Can't afford to make the payment? Contact the lender to ask about hardship options. 4. Set Up Autopay Payment history accounts for 35% of your FICOÂ® ScoreÎ, so once your accounts are all current, keep them that way by setting up autopay. You can generally set up autopay directly with the lender or service provider or through the bank account you use to pay bills. Automatically paying the minimum payment for credit cards and other accounts avoids late payments. Ideally, though, you should pay the balance in full every month. Make sure there's enough money in your account to cover all your autopays to avoid overdrafts or insufficient funds transactions. Learn more: How Does Credit Card Autopay Work? 5. Maintain a Low Credit Utilization Rate Your credit utilization rate measures how much revolving credit you're using relative to your total credit limits. Credit utilization accounts for up to 30% of your credit score. To calculate your credit utilization rate, divide your total credit card balances by your total credit limits and multiply by 100 to get a percent. Do this for each card you hold and for the total of all your credit cards. If your utilization rate is 30% or more overall or on a single account, pay down your credit card balances to see a potential boost to your credit scores. The lower your credit utilization, the better. Learn more: What Is the Best Credit Utilization Ratio? Instantly raise your credit scoresÃ¸ 6. Pay Off Debt If you're carrying debt balances, make a plan for paying them down. Not only is high-interest debt expensive, but the amount of debt you carry has an impact on your score. Here are some ideas for how to pay off debt: Create a debt payoff budget to free up more funds - Tackle debt with the debt snowball or debt avalanche method - Consider taking on a side hustle to put extra money toward your debt - Another option is to consolidate your debt. You can use a debt consolidation loan to pay off your credit cards, then pay back the loan over time in fixed monthly installments. Although debt consolidation loans charge interest, rates are typically lower than credit card interest rates, ultimately saving you money. Plus, one fixed monthly payment can be easier to budget for and pay on time than multiple credit card bills. Learn more: How to Pay Off Debt Listed on Your Credit Report 7. Avoid Applying for New Credit Whenever you apply for new credit, the lender checks your credit report. This is called a hard inquiry and can briefly lower your credit score by a few points. If you truly need new creditâsuch as a debt consolidation loanâdon't apply until you find loans you're likely to qualify for. For example, you can compare personal loans that you're likely to qualify for based on your credit profile. That way, you can get a sense of what rates and terms you have the best odds of being approved for, without doing damage to your credit. 8. Keep Unused Credit Accounts Open After paying off a high credit card balance, closing the card might seem like a smart move. But closing a credit card can negatively affect your credit score by reducing the amount of revolving credit available to you, which could instantly increase your credit utilization rate. Even if you don't plan to use them, it's generally a good idea to keep unused credit cards open. If
