Information quality guidelines The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) Information Quality Guidelines are issued in accordance with the provisions of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001, Pub. L. No. 106-554 (the “Act”), and OMB government-wide guidance. The administrative correction mechanisms outlined in the guidelines apply to information disseminated by the Bureau on or after the date of publication, regardless of when the information was first disseminated. These guidelines provide policy and procedural guidance to Bureau staff and inform the public about Bureau policies and procedures for making corrections to published information. Information Quality and Peer Review Disclaimer: After review of the information disseminated by Bureau, the Bureau does not believe that it currently produces or sponsors the distribution of influential scientific, financial, or statistical information within the definitions promulgated by OMB, and does not at this time have material to post in accordance with OMB’s Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review. The Bureau disseminates a variety of information to the public, including press releases, publications, and special technical reports. Section 515 of the Act requires federal agencies to issue guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity of disseminated information and to provide the public with an administrative means for correction of information disseminated by the Bureau. Information quality correspondence At this time, we’ve received two information quality correction requests: The first request was submitted by the Community Financial Services Association of America on June 20, 2013, and we responded on August 19, 2013. CFSA filed an appeal of the Bureau’s response on Sep. 18, 2013, which the Bureau denied on Nov. 18, 2013. - The second request was submitted by Advance America Cash Advance Centers Inc. on July 19, 2016, and we responded on Sep. 13, 2016. - Information quality guidelines The Bureau strives to ensure and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information that it disseminates to the public. The Bureau strives to incorporate information quality criteria into its information dissemination practices, and ensures the quality of information the agency disseminates in accordance with the standards set forth in these Guidelines. The Bureau is committed to integrating the principle of information quality into its development of information, including the creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination of such information. The Bureau will comply with all legal and policy rules, regulations, directives, and guidance governing any phase of the process. High quality information represents a performance goal for organizational components of the Bureau who are charged with disseminating information. To ensure and maximize quality information, the standards should focus on the three underlying requirements for quality: utility, objectivity, and integrity of information. Utility: In assessing the usefulness of information disseminated to the public, the Bureau will consider how the public will use the information. When transparency of information is relevant to an assessment of the public’s perception of its usefulness, the Bureau will address transparency – the clear, obvious, and precise nature of the data or analysis – when developing and reviewing information. - Objectivity: The Bureau will consider whether disseminated information is accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased both in presentation and substance. Information will be presented within its proper context. Where appropriate, data will be accompanied by full, accurate, and transparent documentation, and will disclose error sources affecting its quality. Analytic results will be generated using sound statistical and research methods. - Integrity: The Bureau will protect information from unauthorized access or revision, to prevent corruption or falsification of information. The Bureau will comply with government-wide security requirements when disseminating information. - The Bureau will strive to ensure that statistical and financial data disseminated by the Bureau is capable of being substantially reproduced by an independent evaluator, subject to some degree of imprecision. The Bureau will also provide the sources, methods, procedures, references, and assumptions employed to create information disseminated
