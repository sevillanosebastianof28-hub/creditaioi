How to Earn Cash Back With a Debit Card Quick Answer Cash back debit cards offer rewards on your everyday purchases or on purchases with select merchants. However, rewards rates typically aren't as lucrative compared to cash back credit cards.

The terms can vary, with some offering cash back on every purchase, while others limit your rewards-earning power to select merchants.
