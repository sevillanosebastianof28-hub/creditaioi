the picture; you may also be responsible for a down payment, closing costs, taxes, insurance and other expenses. Online mortgage calculators may help you find a starting range. Gather your documents Realtors, not just potential lenders, will want to make sure they show you homes in your budget, and with their experience, they know where some of the gaps may be. Be prepared for questions with any required documents, such as tax returns, pay stubs, and bank statements, which you’ll also need to prequalify and apply for a mortgage. One important thing you can do as soon as you start thinking about buying a home is checking your credit report. Ideally, this should be done at least six months before you purchase to give yourself time to dispute any information you believe is inaccurate or incomplete, if needed. It’s also important to know how your payment history is being reported by your current creditors. Look for any information that might be inaccurate or incomplete. Is your personal information, including your address, correct and up to date? Are there any addresses you don’t recognize? Are all of the accounts listed complete and accurate? Do the balances appear accurate? Are there any accounts you don’t recognize? If you see something that appears inaccurate or incomplete, contact the company. You can also file a dispute with the credit bureau that provided the report. To file a dispute with Equifax, visit our dispute page. Technology has changed the process of obtaining a mortgage, with online mortgages becoming more popular. But because so much personal information is required to get a mortgage, it’s a good idea to keep security in mind. Here are some suggestions: Use reputable companies. Check out lenders you’re unfamiliar with. Make sure the company’s web site is secure and offers a contact number for you to call with any questions or concerns. You can check to see if each lender you consider is registered in your state through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System Registry. You can also search the Better Business Bureau for information on lenders. - Use a secure network. Don’t apply for loans on public WiFi. - Be careful sending information over email. Make sure the company uses a secure, password-protected online portal. If you’re faxing documents, make sure someone is on the receiving end to pick them up. - Don’t respond to suspicious emails. If you receive an email that seems to be from your lender, but it appears suspicious, contact the company to verify it’s legitimate - Monitor your credit reports and bank accounts after you’ve applied. Keeping an eye on your credit reports and accounts may help spot suspicious activity early. - Remember, applying for a mortgage will likely appear as an inquiry on your credit report, so think twice before applying to multiple lenders individually.
