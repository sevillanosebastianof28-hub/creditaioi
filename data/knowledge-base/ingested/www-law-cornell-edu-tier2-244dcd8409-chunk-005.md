Justice’s family. B. Civic and Charitable Activities. A Justice may participate in and serve as an officer, director, trustee, or nonlegal advisor of a nonprofit civic, charitable, educational, religious, or social organization, subject to the following limitations: (1) A Justice should not serve if it is likely that the organization will either be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the Justice or be regularly engaged in adversary proceedings in any court. (2) A Justice should not give investment advice to such an organization but may serve on its board of directors or trustees even though it has the responsibility for approving investment decisions. C. FUNDRAISING. A Justice may assist nonprofit law-related, civic, charitable, educational, religious, or social organizations in planning fundraising activities and may be listed as an officer, director, or trustee. Use of a Justice’s name, position in the organization, and judicial designation on an organization’s letter head, including when used for fundraising or soliciting members, is permissible if comparable information and designations are listed for others. Otherwise, a Justice should not personally participate in fundraising activities, solicit funds for any organization, or use or knowingly permit the use of the prestige of judicial office for that purpose. A Justice should not personally participate in membership solicitation if the solicitation might reasonably be perceived as coercive or is essentially a fundraising mechanism. D. Financial Activities. (1) A Justice may hold and manage investments, including real estate and engage in other remunerative activity, but should refrain from financial and business dealings that exploit the judicial position or involve the Justice in frequent transactions or continuing business relationships with lawyers likely to appear before the Court or other persons likely to come before the Court. (2) A Justice may serve as an officer, director, active partner, manager, advisor, or employee of a business only if the business is closely held and controlled by members of the Justice’s family. For this purpose, “members of the Justice’s family” means persons related to the Justice or the Justice’s spouse within the third degree of relationship as defined in Canon 3B(6)(a), any other relative with whom the Justice or the Justice’s spouse maintains a close familial relationship, and the spouse of any of the foregoing. (3) A Justice should comply with the restrictions on acceptance of gifts and the prohibition on solicitation of gifts set forth in the Judicial Conference Regulations on Gifts now in effect. A Justice should endeavor to prevent any member of the Justice’s family residing in the household from soliciting or accepting a gift except to the extent that a Justice would be permitted to do so by the Judicial Conference Gift Regulations. A “member of the Justice’s family” means any relative of a Justice by blood, adoption, or marriage, or any person treated by a Justice as a member of the Justice’s family. (4) A Justice should not disclose or use nonpublic information acquired in a judicial capacity for any purpose unrelated to the Justice’s official duties. E. Fiduciary Activities. A Justice may serve as the executor, administrator, trustee, guardian, or other fiduciary only for the estate, trust, or person of a member of the Justice’s family as defined in Canon 4D(3). As a family fiduciary a Justice is subject to the following restrictions: (1) The Justice should not serve if it is likely that as a fiduciary the Justice would be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the Justice or if the estate, trust, or ward becomes involved in adversary proceedings before the Court or in a court under the Court’s jurisdiction. (2) While acting as a fiduciary, a Justice is subject to the same restrictions on financial activities that apply to a Justice in a personal capacity. F. Governmental Appointments. A Justice may accept appointment to a governmental committee, commission, or other position only
