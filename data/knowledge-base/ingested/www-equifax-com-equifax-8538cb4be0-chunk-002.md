If you’re using a private WiFi network, make sure that it’s only accessible using a strong password. If you have to use a public network, you may want to access the web using a virtual private network (VPN) connection, which sends data securely through the Internet. There are free VPN services available. For safer online shopping, you may also want to avoid activities like banking or online purchases on public WiFi. - Lastly, it's always a good idea to keep an eye on your credit and banking account statements for possible fraudulent activity. If anything looks suspicious, you can contact the lender or creditor, and also contact your financial institutions. Regularly checking your credit reports can help spot any activity you don’t recognize, which may be a sign of potential identity theft.
