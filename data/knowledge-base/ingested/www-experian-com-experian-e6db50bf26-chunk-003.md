Before they submit the request, however, make sure the account has a positive history that can help improve your credit score. - Avoid applying for new credit unless you need it. - Get credit for paying your utility and phone billsâthese payments typically don't get reported to the credit bureaus, but with Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸, you can allow Experian to connect your bank accounts and use the data to identify utility and phone payments.
