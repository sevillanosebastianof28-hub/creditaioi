Article I, Section 4, Clause 1: The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. By its terms, Article I, Section 4, Clause 1, referred to as the Elections Clause, contemplates that state legislatures will establish the times, places, and manner of holding elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate, subject to Congress making or altering such state regulations (except as to the place of choosing Senators).1 The Supreme Court has interpreted the Elections Clause expansively, enabling states “to provide a complete code for congressional elections, not only as to times and places, but in relation to notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.” 2 The Court has further recognized the states’ ability to establish sanctions for violating election laws3 as well as authority over recounts4 and primaries.5 The Elections Clause, however, does not govern voter qualifications, which under Article I, Section 2, Clause 1, and the Seventeenth Amendment must be the same as the “Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislatures.” 6 Similarly, the authority of states to establish the “Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives” does not include authority to impose additional qualification requirements to be a Member of the House of Representatives or a Senator, which are governed by the Constitution’s Qualification Clauses at Article I, Section 2, Clause 2 for Members of the House and at Article I, Section 3, Clause 3 for the Senate.7 State authority to regulate the times, places, and manner of holding congressional elections has been described by the Court as the ability “to enact the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental rights involved.” 8 The Court has upheld a variety of state laws designed to ensure that elections are fair and honest and orderly.9 But the Court distinguished state laws that go beyond “protection of the integrity and regularity of the election process,” and instead operate to disadvantage a particular class of candidates10 or negate the need for a general election.11 The Court noted that the Elections Clause does not allow states to set term limits, which the Court viewed as “disadvantaging a particular class of candidates and evading the dictates of the Qualifications Clause,” 12 or ballot labels identifying candidates who disregarded voters’ instructions on term limits or declined to pledge support for them.13 In its 1995 decision in U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, the Court explained: “[T]he Framers understood the Elections Clause as a grant of authority to issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.” 14 The Supreme Court has held that Article I, Section 4, Clause 1, provides for Congress, not the courts, to regulate how states exercise their authority over Senate and House elections,15 although courts may hear cases concerning claims of one-person, one-vote violations and racial gerrymandering.16 For example, in its 2019 Rucho v. Common Cause decision, the Court held that partisan gerrymandering claims—claims that one political party has gerrymandered congressional districts to the disadvantage of the other party—are not justiciable by courts because “the only provision in the Constitution [Article I, Section 4, Clause 1] that specifically addresses the matter assigns it to the political branches” 17 and such claims present political questions— “outside the courts’ competence and therefore beyond the courts’ jurisdiction” —that are not for courts to decide.18 Although noting
