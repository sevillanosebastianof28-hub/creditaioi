most affordable car insurance for you. How to Save on Car Insurance Whether your current car insurance premiums are above average, below average or somewhere in between, there are several steps you can take to save on car insurance. Increase your deductible. You can choose your deductible, which is the amount you're responsible for when you file a claim. Raising the deductible generally lowers your premiums. Just be sure you could afford to pay the higher deductible if necessary. - Drop unnecessary coverage. Cutting out extras such as roadside assistance or rental car reimbursement coverage could lower your car insurance rates. If your paid-off car is older and not worth very much, and you could afford to repair or replace it out of pocket, you may want to drop collision and comprehensive coverage. - Look for available discounts. Check with your car insurance company and other providers to see what discounts they offer. You could get discounts for bundling home and auto insurance, taking a defensive driving class or driving less than the average mileage. Your employer or an organization you belong to might offer car insurance discounts too. - Improve your credit. Insurance companies in most states can use your credit-based insurance score when determining your premiums. In those states, poor credit could mean paying more for auto insurance. Taking steps to improve your consumer credit score could positively impact your credit-based insurance score, potentially saving you money on car insurance. - Shopping around with a variety of providers can help you find lower rates on car insurance. You can get auto insurance quotes by visiting insurance company websites or contacting insurance companies.
