Remedying the Effects of Identity Theft You are receiving this information because you have notified a consumer reporting agency that you believe that you are a victim of identity theft. Identity theft occurs when someone uses your name, Social Security number, date of birth, or other identifying information, without authority, to commit fraud. For example, someone may have committed identity theft by using your personal information to open a credit card account or get a loan in your name. For more information,Â www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmoreÂ or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you specific rights when you are, or believe that you are, the victim of identity theft. Here is a brief summary of the rights designed to help you recover from identity theft. You have the right to ask that nationwide consumer reporting agencies place âfraud alertsâ in your file to let potential creditors and others know that you may be a victim of identity theft.Â A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must place fraud alerts in your file. An initial fraud alert stays in your file for at least one year. AnÂ extended alert stays in your file for seven years. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask for anÂ extended alert, you will have to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For more detailed information about theÂ identity theft report, visitÂ www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. You have the right to free copies of the information in your file (your âfile disclosureâ).Â An initial fraud alertÂ entitles you to a copy of all the information in your file at each of the three nationwide agencies, and anÂ extended alert entitles you to two free file disclosures in a 12-month period following the placing of the alert. These additional disclosures may help you detect signs of fraud, for example, whether fraudulent accounts have been opened in your name or whether someone has reported a change in your address. Once a year, you also have the right to a free copy of the information in your file at any consumer reporting agency, if you believe it has inaccurate information due to fraud, such as identity theft. You also have the ability to obtain additional free file disclosures under other provisions of the FCRA. SeeÂ www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. You have the right to obtain documents relating to fraudulent transactions made or accounts opened using your personal information.Â A creditor or other business must give you copies of applications and other business records relating to transactions and accounts that resulted from the theft of your identity, if you ask for them in writing. A business may ask you for proof of your identity, a police report, and an affidavit before giving you the documents. It may also specify an address for you to send your request. Under certain circumstances a business can refuse to provide you with these documents. SeeÂ www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. You have the right to obtain information from a
