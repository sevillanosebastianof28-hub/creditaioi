passes once they reach the vessel, so the seller is not liable. The receiver—or buyer—assumes responsibility once the goods are loaded on the vessel. All remaining costs including those for unloading and any further transportation costs are assumed by the receiver or buyer. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Decoding Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) Obligations Like CFR, CIF is restricted for use between parties who deal in goods that are transported by sea. CIF agreements are also nearly the same as CFR agreements. The seller is still responsible for all arrangements and transport costs for shipping goods to the agreed-upon destination port. The receiver then assumes all cost responsibilities once the goods have been loaded on the vessel. The difference between the two agreements, though, lies in one additional responsibility that falls on the shipper (seller), who must also provide a minimum amount of marine insurance on the goods being shipped. The amount of insurance is typically agreed upon between the buyer and seller. The seller is also responsible for any additional costs that come with transporting the goods. This includes any extra paperwork required for customs or inspections, or any rerouting that must be done during transport. The terms of the contract will outline the exact nature of the responsibilities of the seller prior to transport. Most CIF contracts will outline the following for the seller: The purchase of export licenses for the product as requiredCovering the cost and contracts of transporting the goodsThe requirement of insurance to protect the orderProviding the necessary inspections for the productsIf required, paying for any damage or destruction to the order Practical Example of CFR vs. CIF in Action Company A in Morocco sells goods to a buyer in the U.S., Company Z. Company A pays for the shipping from Morocco to the U.S. and is responsible for the shipment until the goods are loaded on the vessel, at which point Company Z bears responsibility, which applies for both CFR and CIF. Under CIF, the additional stipulations require that Company A purchase insurance for the goods being transferred. The insurance is to cover the loss or damage to the goods during the carriage. What Is the Difference Between FCA and CFR? CFR refers to "cost and freight" while FCA refers to "free carrier." FCA stipulates that the seller and buyer must agree on the point of delivery, as that is the point where responsibility passes from the seller to the buyer. CFR stipulates that the seller is responsible up until the goods are loaded onto the vessel at the exporting port. Who Pays Freight in CFR Incoterms? The seller pays freight in CFR (cost and freight) incoterms. The seller is responsible for the shipment until the goods are loaded on the vessel at the exporting port. Why Is It Called Incoterms? "Incoterms" is an abbreviation for "International Commercial Terms." The terms help clarify shipping rules between international trading partners where otherwise each trading partner from a different country may have different beliefs on who pays for shipping, who buys insurance, and when each party bears responsibility. Incoterms help create one set of standard rules. The Bottom Line CFR and CIF are similar terms related to transporting goods by sea when the cost of shipping the freight lies with the seller. The difference between the two is that CIF requires marine insurance to be included, paid by the seller, which provides protection against any damages to the goods.
