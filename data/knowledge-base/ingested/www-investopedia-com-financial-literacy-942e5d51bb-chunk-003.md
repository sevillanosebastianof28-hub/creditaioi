& Casualty Companies Asset-liability management is crucial to property and casualty companies as well, but the risk exposures of these companies vary from life insurers in a number of areas. While the product offerings are more diverse—home, automobile, motorcycle, boat, liability, umbrella, flood etc.—the durations of these liabilities are much shorter: generally a year or less per policy. Therefore, the investment portfolios of these companies will tend to consist of high-quality bonds with maturities of a few months to a year. Additionally, claims can take a long time to be resolved and paid out. The claims process can be contentious and possibly spend years in litigation before the claim is paid – if it is paid at all. Many non-life policies also carry inflation risk, as the policies promise to fully replace the value of an item, even if that item is nominally more expensive in the future due to inflation. Taken together, both the timing and amount of liabilities are more uncertain than for life companies. Property and casualty insurance companies also undergo an underwriting cycle or profitability cycle, which typically lasts 3-5 years. During period of intense business competition, prices on policies are reduced to retain business and capture market share (think of all the advertisements claiming to lower the cost of your car insurance). Frequently, prices of securities in the insurance company's portfolio fall below sustainable levels and lead to losses as claims on policies are paid out. The company must then liquidate portfolio assets to supplement cash flow, and share prices may drop. Insurers are forced to raise the prices of policies and profitability begins to grow once again, opening the door for renewed competition. As a result, property casualty insurance companies will tend to invest in a portfolio of taxable bonds during the period of the cycle where losses occur and switch to non-taxable bonds such as municipal bonds during periods of positive profits. Some of the largest property and casualty insurance companies listed on stock exchanges where investors can buy shares are: Allstate (ALL), Progressive (PGR), Berkshire Hathaway (which owns Geico and a number of other insurance companies), Travelers (TRV), and Zurich (ZURVY:OTC). Important Several ETFs exist to give investors more broad exposure to the insurance industry, including: SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE); Invesco KBW Property & Casualty Insurance ETF (KBWP); and iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (IAK). The Bottom Line Knowing the special circumstances that insurance companies operate under helps in evaluating whether or not a listed insurance company is a good investment and whether the economic environment is conducive to profitability for these companies. High interest rate environments can be detrimental to life insurance companies as they face disintermediation risk. Property and casualty insurance companies are subject to the ebbs and flows of the profitability cycle. Being able to recognize when the economics of these industries are changing might make for buy or sell signals accordingly. Also keeping in mind the duration and maturities of the bonds in the portfolios of different kinds of insurance companies can help determine how change in interest rates will effect each.
