Pros Accessibility: Your security deposit reduces the card issuer's risk, which can make secured credit cards easier to qualify for than unsecured cards, even if you don't have good credit. - May help improve credit: Using a secured credit card responsibly could help improve your credit score if the card issuer reports your payments to the three consumer credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. - Potential to upgrade to unsecured card: Depending on the card issuer, you may be automatically upgraded to a secured credit card or may have the option to request an upgrade. You'll typically need to demonstrate responsible card use for six to 12 months before you're eligible to upgrade; check with the card issuer for details. - May offer rewards: Some secured credit cards offer rewards such as cash back on purchases, which can be a valuable perk. - Cons Upfront deposit required: Making a security deposit to get a secured credit card could put a strain on your finances, especially if you want a higher credit limit. Check your card issuer's deposit refund policy to see when you'll be able to get your deposit back. - Low credit limits: Secured cards typically have low credit limits, which can reduce your financial flexibility. A low limit also makes it easy to use a high percentage of your available credit, which can negatively impact your credit score. - APR may be high: Because they're designed for people with poor or no credit, secured credit cards usually charge higher APRs than unsecured cards. - May charge fees: Some secured credit cards charge fees, such as annual fees, late payment fees or foreign transaction fees. - Learn more: Do Secured Credit Cards Build Credit History?

If you're a recent immigrant, a young adult or simply have never used credit, you may not have a credit history. This could make it challenging to get an unsecured credit card. A secured credit card offers a low barrier to entry, making it a good first step on the road to building credit. - You have a thin credit file. A credit report with fewer than five active credit accounts is known as a thin credit file and can limit your options. Adding a secured credit card can fatten up your thin file and diversify your credit mix, which could help improve your credit score. - You're trying to rebuild your credit. Maxed-out credit cards, collection accounts and other negative marks on your credit report can make lenders wary. Secured credit cards pose less risk for card issuers, so they're typically more accessible even with bad credit. Once you've been approved, using the card responsibly can help repair your credit. - Your applications for unsecured credit cards have been rejected. If you've been denied a credit card for whatever reason, the required deposit for a secured credit card can make approval more likely. - Learn more: What Is
