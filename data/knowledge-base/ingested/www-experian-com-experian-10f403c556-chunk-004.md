This preventive measure lets your bank know that transactions from your destination are legitimate, not fraud. For the same reason, let your bank know of any upcoming large or unusual purchases that differ from your usual spending habits. Review Your Accounts Regularly Checking your account balance frequently can keep you informed when your balance is low and help prevent declined transactions due to insufficient funds. Additionally, consider signing up for text alerts to be notified when your balance is low. Reviewing your account activity can also help you spot any unrecognized transactions. If you do notice a suspicious debit card transaction, notify your bank immediately. Sign Up for Overdraft Protection Some banks and credit unions allow customers to enroll in overdraft protection, which could help you avoid getting declined if you attempt to make a purchase that exceeds the available funds in your account. Typically, your bank will cover the difference by automatically transferring money from one of your linked accounts, such as a savings account. Keep in mind that overdraft protection may have associated fees. Know Your Card's Expiration Date You might set up text alerts or calendar reminders to let you know when your debit card is about to expire. Once you receive your new card, activate it immediately and update your payment information for any recurring payments you've set up to make sure they go through as planned.
