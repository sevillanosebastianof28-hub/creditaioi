Pros & Cons Pros No late fees Same-day funding available Access to SoFi membership benefits Cons Optional origination fees Can’t apply with a co-signer, but co-borrowers are accepted High minimum loan amounts Overview You can find lenders offering lower rates and more flexible loan minimums. But only a few lenders we researched offer loan amounts up to $100,000, and only one, specialty lender BHG Financial, offers larger ones (up to $200,000). Plus, you’re unlikely to find a lender that offers more customer perks and benefits than SoFi. Those benefits include free financial advice and discounts on other banking and financial products it offers. That focus on customer experience is working for SoFi. It ranked fourth in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study. Sofi also received an Investopedia Combined Consumer Review rating of 4.4 (out of 5 possible), a calculated aggregate of consumer review ratings on Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau developed by Investopedia’s researchers. Like LightStream, SoFi has a high loan minimum of $5,000, so if you need a smaller loan, you must look elsewhere. In years past, the lender touted its lack of fees. That’s changed now, and SoFi offers borrowers the option to pay an origination fee of up to 7% in exchange for a lower interest rate overall. You still won’t face late fees and prepayment fees. San Francisco-based SoFi was founded in 2011 as a fintech specializing in student loans. Today, it offers a full suite of banking and financial products, including checking and savings accounts, home loans, investment accounts, insurance, and more.
