Home Equity Loans vs. Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC) Highlights: When facing a major expense, some homeowners may use a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to borrow money against the equity in their home. - What is a home equity loan? A home equity loan allows you to borrow a lump sum of money against your home's existing equity. - What is a HELOC Loan? A HELOC also leverages a home's equity, but allows homeowners to apply for an open line of credit. You then can borrow up to a fixed amount on an as-needed basis. - When facing a major expense, such as financing a home renovation, consolidating debt or paying for an education, some homeowners choose to borrow money against the equity in their home. In these situations, borrowers may turn to either a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Whether you need a one-time lump sum or access to cash on an as-needed basis, these types of financing can be flexible and accessible options. What is home equity? Home equity is your property's market value minus the amount you owe on any liens, such as your mortgage. Most homeowners first gain equity by putting a down payment on their property. Your equity then fluctuates over time as you make monthly mortgage payments and as the market value of your home changes. Renovations and repairs to your home, or changes to property values in your community may also impact your home equity. What is a home equity loan? A home equity loan, also known as a second mortgage, is a debt that is secured by your home. Generally, lenders will let you borrow no more than 80% of the equity that you have put into your home. With a home equity loan, you receive a lump sum of money. These loans typically come with a fixed interest rate and have a term of five, 10, or 15 years. The interest rate you qualify for will depend in part on your credit scores, which are generated from information on your credit reports. Once you receive the lump sum, you'll need to pay back the loan and interest within the time period outlined in the loan contract. Typically, home equity loan payments are fixed and paid monthly. If you default on your loan by missing payments, or become unable to pay off the debt, the lender may take ownership of your property through a legal process known as foreclosure. If faced with foreclosure, you may be forced to sell your home in order to pay off the remaining debt. Home equity loan requirements Applying for a home equity loan can be a lengthy process and approval is not guaranteed. Lenders will thoroughly review your financial health to determine whether you qualify. This process may include examining your credit reports to verify your borrowing history and appraising your home to determine its market value. Similar to how many other loans work, your application is more likely to move forward if you can demonstrate an ability to repay what you intend to borrow. Lenders will generally consider the following factors when reviewing your application: Home equity. You need to have a certain amount of equity established in your home before you can use it to secure a loan. Most lenders require that you have already paid off at least 15% to 20% of your home's total value to qualify. The lender appraises your home's market value as part of the application process, which typically comes at your expense. - Debt-to-income ratio. Your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio may also help determine whether you qualify. Your DTI ratio is calculated by dividing your total monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. While qualifying DTIs vary depending on the lender, the general rule
