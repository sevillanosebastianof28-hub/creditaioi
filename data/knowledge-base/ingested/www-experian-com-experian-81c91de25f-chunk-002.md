are reduced when your costs exceed $50,000. Above the $50,000 threshold, your deductible costs may be amortized or spread out over multiple years. 4. Home Office Expenses Employees working remotely can't deduct their home office expenses, but self-employed people can. This deduction applies only to space used regularly and exclusively for business that is also your principal place of business. You can't claim the sofa as your headquarters if you also use it as a place to watch TV with your family. Similarly, if you maintain a regular office and use your guest room as a home office occasionally, the deduction doesn't apply. Deductible expenses include mortgage interest or rent, utilities, insurance, depreciation, real estate taxes, maintenance and repairs. - Direct expenses (for instance, re-flooring your office space) are 100% deductible. - Indirect expenses are deductible based on the percentage of your home that is dedicated to business use. For example, if your home is 2,000 square feet and your office is 200 square feet, 10% of your home's indirect allowable expenses can be deducted. Be aware: Expenses associated with the parts of your home that are not used for businessâlandscaping, for exampleâare not deductible. - You may also choose a simplified option that allows you to deduct a straight $5 per square foot of dedicated business space as a home office expense. This option caps out at 300 square feet or $1,500. Learn more: How to Qualify for the Home Office Tax Deduction 5. Rent Of course, if you rent a dedicated space for your business, you can deduct the cost of rentâand save yourself the trouble of calculating a home office deduction. The IRS has rules for claiming a deduction for rent, however, including that you cannot own the property you're renting and you can't deduct rent you've paid in advance for future years.

Tips A new "no tax on tips" deduction introduced as part of the 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act applies to self-employed people who receive tips as part of their business. Qualified tips must be reported on Form 1099 or Form W-2. The deduction is worth up to $25,000 (not to exceed your net income) and may be claimed whether you itemize or use the standard deduction. It begins phasing out when your income exceeds $150,000, or $300,000 as a joint filer. This deduction is in effect from 2025 to 2028. 7. Health Insurance You may be able to deduct medical, dental and qualified long-term care insurance premiums you've paid for you and your family. Self-employed people can deduct health insurance premiums as a business expense with two important caveats: You and your spouse cannot be eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored health plan. - You must show a net business profit for the year. - 8. Retirement Contributions Contributions to certain retirement accounts may be deductible if you're self-employed, including contributions you make for your employees. If you open a SEP-IRA, you can contribute as much as 25% of your net earnings from self-employment, up to $70,000 for 2025 and $72,000 for 2026. - Start a Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE IRA) to provide retirement plan contributions with employer matching funds for you and your employees. You can contribute up to $16,500 in 2025 and $17,000 in 2026. Individuals who qualify for a higher SIMPLE contribution under SECURE 2.0 can contribute up to $17,600 in 2025 and $18,100 in 2026. - You can contribute to a Solo 401(k) as both an employee and employer. In 2025, the contribution limit for employees is $23,500; employers can contribute an additional 25% of earned income. - Learn more: Ways to Save for Retirement When You're Self-Employed 9.
