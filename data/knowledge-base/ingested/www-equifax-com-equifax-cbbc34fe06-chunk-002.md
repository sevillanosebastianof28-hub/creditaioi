online. - Balance their screen time with other activities. - Try an Internet-filtering tool to help with supervision. These tools can block certain pages or content. Disable pop-ups to prevent pop-up ads, some of which may contain viruses or malware. - Internet safety ages 5-7 As they get older, children begin to develop trust and enjoy conversing and sharing ideas, which can make it easy to target them online. From 5 to 7 years old, children may be more capable at using a mouse, following commands and playing online games and apps. With this, they may become vulnerable to online marketers asking for personal info through registration forms, contests, and surveys. A few practices to consider implementing: Enable ad-blockers. These use filter rules that know what to hide and block on websites your children visit. - Talk to older siblings about ensuring younger siblings aren’t around if they’re participating in online activities or games intended for older youth. - Begin a conversation about respecting privacy. Instruct children to not share information with anyone about themselves or the family without checking with you first. - Games and apps for older children often have chat features, so start talking to them about the importance of treating others online with respect and kindness. - Set a rule that your child may not interact with strangers online without your consent. - Internet safety ages 8-10 By the time children are 8 to 10 years old, they may be more interested in what older siblings are doing, but they also may begin to develop a sense of their own identity. Virtual worlds, online games, and online videos may be favorite pastimes, but social networking platforms can also come into play at this point. This is also the age parents may begin to introduce personal cell phones to their kids. At this age, children are at a higher risk of communicating with online acquaintances and may be influenced by media personalities and images. When playing in virtual worlds, they may also begin to explore different identities and behaviors. A few practices to consider implementing: Create a shared family email rather than letting them have their own account. - If they want to start using social networks, have them manage a family page. This can help them learn and practice privacy and safety skills with guidance from you and older siblings. - Preview all websites, games, and apps they wish to use. - Familiarize yourself with parental control features on video game systems, tablets, smartphones, and computers. - Talk with them about safe and ethical social networking: only adding people you know, for instance. You can also talk about treating people online with kindness and respect, and not adding apps without permission. - Talk to them about their online friends and activities in the same way you would about their friends from school. - Internet safety ages 11-13 By this age, most children live in a world of 24/7 communication. By eighth grade, many children may have regular access to a smartphone. At this age, they’re more susceptible to seeking out harmful sites and building relationships with online acquaintances. As your children get ready to enter middle school or junior high, they’re feeling more in control when it comes to technology and may assume they know how to protect themselves online; however, they still need some guidance and supervision. A few practices to consider implementing: Make your children’s bedrooms a tech-free zone at night. - Explore privacy settings on apps and websites with them and begin a discussion around managing who sees what they post. - Talk about healthy relationships and recognizing signs when someone may be seeking to exploit or abuse them. - Create a “piggy bank” for their online account passwords. Make sure they understand you will access them only if you have serious concerns.
