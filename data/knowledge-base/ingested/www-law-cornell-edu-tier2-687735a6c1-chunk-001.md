real estate Real estate is a piece of land, including any artificial or natural property permanently attached to it, above or beneath, such as a house, a building, a tree, or minerals. Personal property like vehicles is not part of real estate. The owner of real estate has real property rights. There are different classes of real estate, such as residential, commercial, and industrial real estate. [Last reviewed in July of 2021 by the Wex Definitions Team] Wex
