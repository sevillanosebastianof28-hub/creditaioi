card. When you're an authorized user, you enjoy the benefit of the primary cardholder's credit history and can use the card to make purchases (if the primary cardholder agrees). If the primary cardholder makes on-time payments and maintains a low balance, your credit score could improve. Keep in mind that for this approach to work, the issuer of the credit card must report you as an authorized user to the credit reporting companies. 4. You've Submitted Too Many Credit Applications When you apply for new credit and a lender checks your credit reports, it triggers what's known as a hard inquiry. A couple of hard inquiries as you're routinely applying for a loan or credit card might have little, if any, effect on your credit score. But a slew of recent hard inquiries that appear on your credit reports could make you a riskier borrower in the eyes of lenders and credit scoring models. Several hard inquiries over a short period could be a factor preventing your credit score from going up. To help lift your credit score, try keeping the number of hard inquiries to a minimum. Hard inquiries might remain on your credit report for two years, yet the effect on your credit score decreases as time goes by. 5. You Only Have One Type of Credit Account Your credit mix, or the variety of installment credit accounts and revolving credit accounts in your name, represents 10% of your FICOÂ® Score. An installment credit account is a loan you make fixed payments toward over a set period of time. Once the account is paid off, the account is closed. Installment accounts include mortgages, auto loans, personal loans and student loans. A revolving credit account, such as a credit card, typically requires a minimum monthly payment, but can be borrowed from and repaid repeatedly. The minimum payment on a revolving account can fluctuate depending on your balance. Having a variety of credit accounts shows lenders and credit scoring models that you're able to manage several types of debt. Improving your credit mix may raise your credit score, but you should avoid taking on new debt solely to improve this scoring factor. 6. A Creditor Has Incorrectly Reported Account Information If a creditor has incorrectly reported information about one of your accounts, such as a late payment that never happened or a too-high balance, it may be dragging down your credit scores. Mistakenly reported information that appears on your credit report could include: Closed accounts that appear on your credit reports as open accounts - Accounts that are incorrectly listed as having late or delinquent payments - The same debt listed at least twice - Credit limits for accounts that aren't accurately reported - If you spot information on your credit report you believe to be incorrect, you can dispute the information by contacting the credit reporting company that produced the report. You can also directly contact the creditor that sent the data to the credit reporting company. Checking your credit report on a regular basis allows you to promptly catch and correct errors that could be dragging down your credit score.
