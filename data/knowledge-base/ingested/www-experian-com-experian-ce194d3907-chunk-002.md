If you want to see more accounts paid off ASAP, this may be the better strategy. It could also take some pressure off your finances because you'll juggle fewer monthly payments sooner. - Potential downsides: By the numbers alone, you might save less money with this method than you would with the avalanche strategy. - Learn more: Debt Snowball vs. Debt Avalanche Method 3. Consider Debt Consolidation By consolidating your debts, you may be able to lower your interest rate and streamline your monthly payments. The idea with consolidation is to use a new form of creditâideally one with better termsâto pay off your existing debts. Here are a couple ways to consolidate. Use a Balance Transfer A balance transfer credit card could be a solid choice if you have good credit and can pay off your debt within a year or so. Balance transfer cards often offer an introductory 0% annual percentage rate (APR) for a certain number of monthsâoften more than a year. You transfer your debts to the balance transfer card, saving you money in interest as you pay off the balance. Balance transfer cards typically require good to excellent credit scores. Beyond credit requirements, there are a couple other things to consider before you decide to do a balance transfer: When interest kicks in: Once the introductory period ends, the interest rate will jump up to the card's standard rate and apply to any remaining balance. If you have a plan to pay off your debt before the intro 0% APR period ends, this could be a good option. - Balance transfer fees: Balance transfer cards generally require you to pay a balance transfer fee of typically 3% or 5% of the total transfer amount. The fee for transferring a $5,000 balance could cost you $150 to $250, for instance. - Save with an intro 0% APR balance transfer Use a Debt Consolidation Loan Debt consolidation loans are a type of personal loan designed specifically for paying off high-interest debt, such as credit cards. If you have a good credit score, you may be able to use a consolidation loan to streamline your monthly debt repayments so that you only have to make one monthly payment, rather than multiple. In addition, consolidation loans have a fixed APR and a set repayment schedule, which can add structure to your repayment plan. Here are a couple things to consider before you apply for a debt consolidation loan: Interest and fees: Consolidation loans don't offer an introductory 0% APR, so you'll pay interest right away. Many unsecured debt consolidation loans also come with origination fees, which can range from around 1% to upwards of 10% of the loan amount. The fee typically is deducted from the approved loan amount. - Potential for more debt: Don't use a personal loan to consolidate your credit card debt if you think you may be tempted to rack up new balances on your credit cards. If that happens, you could end up worse off than you were before. - Learn more: Balance Transfer vs. Debt Consolidation Loan: Which Is Best? 4. Adjust Your Budget If you don't already have one, making a budget can help you get out of debt. A budget helps you pinpoint places where you might be able to cut back and allocate income toward paying your lenders. Choose a Budget System Finding a budget plan that works for you can help you stay on track. One option is the 50/30/20 budget rule: Earmark 50% of your net income for essentials, including housing, utilities, transportation, basic food and minimum debt payments. - Set aside 30% of your net income for affording your wants, including streaming subscriptions or eating out. - Use the remaining 20% to add to your savings and make extra payments toward your debt. - Limit Spending While
