deposit money before you can use the card to make payments, and both allow you to make purchases online and at in-person stores. But beyond that, secured credit cards and prepaid cards differ in these major ways. Building Credit Secured credit cards allow you to start building up your credit history. As long as you keep using the card and making at least the minimum payment each month, you won't forfeit your deposit, and you'll build up your payment history over time. Eventually, this strategy can help you qualify for a credit card without a security deposit. In contrast, prepaid cards don't impact your credit. Since you can only spend money you've got on the card and you aren't borrowing any money, there isn't any payment history to report to the credit bureaus and there won't be any impact to your score. How You Pay Apart from the required security deposit, a secured credit card works the same as any other credit card. Each month, you'll receive a monthly statement detailing your transactions and showing your total statement balance and minimum payment due. You'll need to pay at least the minimum to avoid doing damage to your payment history and thus your credit; however, it's even more beneficial to pay off your balance in full to avoid interest charges. A prepaid card allows you to load money onto the card, make purchases with the funds and continue to do so until you've exhausted your deposit. At that point, you would need to deposit more funds onto the card before you can use it again. But you'll never owe monthly payments on your transactionsâyou've already paid for them. Fees As is the case with any type of credit card, it's important to read the cardholder agreement and understand the card's terms before you apply. Secured credit cards can charge a number of fees, such as annual fees and interest. When you're comparison shopping for a secured credit card, compare the fees to find the best card for you. Remember that paying your balance in full each month can help you avoid paying any interest. When it comes to prepaid cards, fees can vary. Some don't assess any fees, but others may charge a small fee every time you make a purchase. Some charge activation fees, monthly fees or even fees when you load more money onto your card. Read the fine print to see how these fees would eat into your funds and then make the best decision for you. Should I Get a Secured Card or a Prepaid Card? Ultimately, deciding whether to get a secured credit card or a prepaid card comes down to your personal needs and goals for the card. When to Consider a Secured Card Between a secured card and a prepaid card, a secured credit card is the clear choice if your aim is to build credit. Making on-time payments and keeping your credit utilization rate low will help you add positive information to your credit history. But before you decide to go this route, consider alternatives. If building credit is your aim, other options include becoming an authorized user on a family member's card or trying Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸, a feature that allows you to get credit for on-time rent, utility, phone and streaming service paymentsâall of which may help you increase your credit score within minutes. When to Consider a Prepaid Card A prepaid card may be the best choice for you if you simply want an alternate method of payment, are trying to allocate a set amount of funds toward budgeting or are giving the prepaid card to someone else, such as for a child's allowance. You won't risk going into debt or incurring any interest charges, but you'll still need to be mindful of fees and read the card's terms. Know Your
