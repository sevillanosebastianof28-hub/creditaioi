from 1% to 8%. They are included in the APR. Since these are upfront fees are often deducted before you begin making payments, subtract the origination fee from the total loan amount to calculate the funds you’ll receive. Credit Score: A credit score is a three-digit number that indicates a borrower’s creditworthiness. Credit scores are calculated by evaluating factors like someone’s payment history, length of credit history, and credit utilization. Lenders will look at a borrower’s credit score to approve someone for a loan and determine the terms of the loan. A higher credit score generally means that a borrower will receive better terms on a loan. Pre-qualification: Some lenders offer borrowers the option of seeing if they qualify for a loan before applying. The lender will run a soft credit check, an inquiry into your credit report that doesn’t affect your credit score. They may require certain information like your name, address, and income. You will then be denied or given possible loan offers. However, pre-qualification does not guarantee approval. You'll still need to complete the whole process of applying for a personal loan to receive funding. Pros & Cons of Personal Loans Pros Flexibility when using funds Lower APRs than credit cards Unsecured personal loans don’t require collateral Fixed interest rates Cons Strong credit required for lower APRs Origination fees and late fees Lack of continued access to credit Pros Explained Flexibility when using funds: With personal loans, borrowers can generally use the funds as they see fit. That means you could use a personal loan to help finance a wedding, pay off moving expenses, and consolidate your debt. A debt consolidation personal loan lets you wrap multiple debt payments into one monthly payment. To make sure you’re actually saving money on interest, pay close attention to the interest rates and loan terms of the new loan. Typically offer lower APRs than credit cards: Personal loans can charge much lower APRs than credit cards, though you'll need a strong credit score to be eligible for the best rates. Unsecured personal loans don’t require collateral: Many personal loans are unsecured, so you won’t have to put up collateral, which can be seized if you default on the loan. However, if you default on an unsecured loan, your account can be sent to collections, which can still negatively impact your credit score. Interest rates are fixed: Many personal loans offer fixed interest rates and fixed payments, so you don’t need to worry about how interest rate changes influence your monthly payments once you’ve taken out a loan. Cons Explained Need a good credit score to qualify for lower APRs: To get the best terms on a personal loan, you’ll probably want a FICO credit score that’s considered “good” or better—that means having a score of more than 670. If you have a lower credit score, you may still qualify but could receive worse terms. May have origination fees and late fees: Before you sign up for a personal loan, pay careful attention to any fees the lender charges. Origination fees are upfront fees that are subtracted from your loan, late fees can be incurred if you fail to make on-time payments, and if you pay off your loan early, you may be on the hook for a prepayment penalty. Lack of continued access to credit: While receiving a lump sum is useful to some, if you prefer having access to an open line of credit that allows you to borrow money as needed, you may consider opting for a credit card or something like a home equity line of credit (HELOC) over a personal loan. Alternatives to Personal Loans A personal loan—available from many online lenders, banks, and credit unions that offer personal loans—can help you cover an emergency expense, make a home improvement, or help you consolidate higher-cost debt,
