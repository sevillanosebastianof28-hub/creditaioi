value of the business on the company's books and adding unrealized capital gains, capital surplus, and voluntary reserves. The calculation is a useful way to compare the company's relative value to other insurance companies. The basic business model of the insurance industry is the acceptance and management of risk. A transfer of risk shifts responsibility for losses from one party to another in return for payment. This system works because some risks are beyond the resources of most individuals and businesses. Loss cost is the total amount of money an insurer must pay to cover claims, including costs to administer and investigate such claims. When determining what insurance premium to charge a policyholder, insurance companies factor in the loss cost. Business net retention, which indicates a business's ability to manage risk and remain profitable, is a measurement of a company's growth and strength during a specific period. In insurance, it is the number of policies remaining after canceled, lapsed, or ceded insurance plans are deducted. The measure represents the company's policy turnover, with only profitable policies kept for the long-term. The list of exclusions in an insurance policy can be extensive. One such provision, the wear and tear exclusion, specifies that losses due to normal deterioration of the insured property are not covered.
