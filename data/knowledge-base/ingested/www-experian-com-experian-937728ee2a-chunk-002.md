An annual percentage rate, or APR, is the true cost to borrow money with credit cards or an installment loan such as a mortgage, student loan, auto loan or personal loan. APR factors in a loan's interest rate plus any other charges, such as: Credit cards typically do not add extra fees when calculating your APR, which is why a credit card interest rate and APR are usually interchangeable. Tip: Because APR includes fees and interest bundled into one number, it can help you better understand the total cost to take out a loan. You can look at the APR when comparing rates between loans to find the cheaper option. Learn more: What Is a Good APR for a Credit Card? How Is APR Calculated? Just like with interest, APR is represented in the form of a percentage of the amount borrowed. Unlike interest, however, calculating a loan's APR takes into account all other costs associated with the loan. For an installment loan, APR is calculated by adding all fees associated with the loan to the interest. You can use the APR calculator below to crunch your own numbers and see how financing charges combine with interest to affect the total cost to borrow. Example: A $10,000 personal loan with an interest rate of 16% and an origination fee of $500 repaid over a term of three years has an APR of 19.51%. APR calculator For credit cards and other types of revolving credit such as home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), APR is the same as the loan's interest rate and doesn't include fees. In these cases, the terms APR and interest rate are interchangeable and either can be used to compare credit rates. What's the Difference Between Interest and APR? While both the interest rate and APR reflect the cost to borrow, APR gives you more direct information about what you're payingâexcept in the case of credit cards. Generally speaking, the two biggest factors that dictate what you'll repay when you take out a loan are the principal borrowed and the interest rate that applies to the loan. In reality, however, you'll also want to consider costs such as origination fees and other lending fees since they also impact what you will ultimately repay. Instead of looking at interest alone, APR helps you see all these costs at a glance. This makes APR a more accurate way to understand a loan or to compare two loans. For example, if two loans have the same interest rate but different APRs, the loan with the lower APR will often be the better deal.
