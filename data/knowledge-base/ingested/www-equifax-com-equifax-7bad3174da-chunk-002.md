are legitimate. Even if the sender claims to be from a company you know and do business with, do not click on a link in the email to log in to your account; instead, go to the company's website to log in. It's also important to know that most financial institutions and government agencies will not request personal information through emails, texts or other types of messages. How to help protect yourself from phishing emails Your spam or junk mail filters may keep some phishing messages out of your inbox, but as scammers and hackers constantly try to get past those filters, you might consider some other ways to help protect yourself. These might include: Use security software. Install security and anti-virus software on your computer or mobile phone and set it to update automatically as new threats arise. - Enable multi-factor authentication. This extra step, which typically requires you to enter a one-time code sent via text or email, makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if they have your username and password. - Back up your data. In the event of a phishing attack, your data can be destroyed or encrypted. Use an external hard drive, a USB drive or cloud storage to back up your device so that you can safely recover your files. - Help! I've been phished! If you clicked on a suspicious link or attachment and are worried about potential phishing, here are some steps you can take: Disconnect your device from the internet as quickly as possible. This may help reduce the risk of malware spreading to other connected devices and may prevent a hacker from remotely accessing your device. - Scan your device with antivirus or security software. You may be able to run the scan, even if you aren't connected to the internet. - Update your passwords. If you entered any personal information, such as a password, use an uncompromised device to change that password on any affected accounts. - Alert any relevant accounts of the breach. If you entered a credit card or bank account number, contact your credit card company or financial institution. - If you believe information such as your credit card number, Social Security number or bank account details has been compromised, visit IdentityTheft.gov to report the theft to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and make a recovery plan. You might also want to consider placing a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit reports with the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies—Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. How to report phishing emails If you receive a phishing email or text message, you can report it and help fight phishing. Forward emails to the FTC at spam@uce.gov and the global Anti-Phishing Working Group at reportphishing@apwg.org. You can forward text messages to SPAM (7726); standard messaging rates may apply. You can also report the phishing attempt to the FTC at ftc.gov/complaint and to the Internet Crime Complaint Center at https://www.ic3.gov. What is smishing? While phishing typically refers to email scams, smishing refers specifically to deceptive text messages. Smishing scams involve contact from an unknown number, often claiming to be from a reputable business. These messages may contain a link that attempts to bait you into clicking it and entering sensitive personal information, such as login details for a secure account or other personal data. Smishers may try to sell the information they gather from you to other scammers, or entice you to download malware onto your smart device. How to identify a smishing attack Smishing has become prevalent as people increasingly use their mobile phones for text messaging and other services like mobile shopping and banking. Since smishing is still relatively new compared to email scams, it catches many mobile users off guard. Here are a few warning signs that can help you identify a smishing attack:
