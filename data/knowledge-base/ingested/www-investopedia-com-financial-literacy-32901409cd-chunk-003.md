of the internet. Insurance buyers increasingly go online to shop for coverage and insurers have changed many of their sales and underwriting practices as a result. The worldwide reach of the internet has also led to further mergers among financial services firms as they compete in what is increasingly a global marketplace. The Bottom Line The roots of American insurance trace back to Benjamin Franklin's founding of the Philadelphia Contributionship in 1752, marking the country's earliest property insurance efforts. As new risks emerged throughout U.S. history, including those from cars and aviation, the insurance industry responded with specialized coverage. Scandals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries prompted regulatory shifts, with insurance oversight moving primarily to the state level after the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945. The rise of the internet has changed how insurance is sold and evaluated, prompting more consolidation and globalization within the industry.
