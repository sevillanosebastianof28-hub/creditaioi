You can submit a request for Equifax to remove or block adverse information resulting from human trafficking from your Equifax credit report by sending a letter explaining your request and the required supporting documents and information (see below for more) to Equifax at the address below: Equifax Information Services, LLC P.O. Box 105874 Atlanta, GA 30348 You can also submit your request and required supporting documents online through a free myEquifax account. In myEquifax, visit the Dispute Center and click the link in the “For Victims of Human Trafficking” section. You may also call us at (833) 240-3461 to speak to an agent about the process for submitting a request related to information resulting from human trafficking. What do I need to include with my request for Equifax to remove information resulting from human trafficking? For Equifax to process your request and remove information from your Equifax credit report that is the result of human trafficking, you need to include the following documents and information with your request: A document that confirms that you were a victim of human trafficking, which may be one or more of the following types of documents: A document that includes a determination that you were a victim of a form of human trafficking from: A federal, state, tribal, or local governmental entity, government agency, or law enforcement entity; or - A non-governmental entity or task force authorized by a governmental agency to make such a determination; - - A self-attestation, which is a statement prepared by you (or your representative) stating that you were a victim of human trafficking that is certified by an authorized employee or representative of a governmental agency or non-governmental entity; or - One or more documents from a court indicating a determination by a court that you were a victim of human trafficking in a case where a central issue is whether you are a victim of human trafficking. Court documents can be made up of several documents from the court case that together show that the court accepted as true or found no genuine dispute that you were a victim of human trafficking; and - - A document that includes a determination that you were a victim of a form of human trafficking from: - Proof of identity, which may include copies of a government issued ID, driver’s license, birth certificate, passport, Social Security card or W2 (make sure any photocopies are clear and readable); and - A statement identifying (1) the specific items of adverse information on your Equifax credit report that resulted from human trafficking (for example, by including the account number and creditor name) and (2) the mailing address (or email address) that Equifax should use to communicate with you in writing about your request. - If a designated representative, like your attorney or a victim assistance advocate, is preparing your statement or submitting your request on your behalf, they must also include proof of their identity and documentation that you have authorized them to act for you, like a valid power of attorney. Call us at (833) 240-3461 if you have additional questions. If adverse information due to human trafficking appears on your TransUnion or Experian credit reports, you will need to send a request to each of them separately: Experian P.O.
