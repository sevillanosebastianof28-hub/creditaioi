reasons for being denied include: No credit history - Low income - Too many recent applications - Ask for Reconsideration If you think there was a mistake, ask the credit card issuer to reconsider your application. Providing additional information, like another source of income, can help. After reviewing your request, the card issuer may reverse their decision and approve your application. Wait Before Reapplying Credit card applications add a hard inquiry to your credit report, which can hurt your chances of getting approved if you apply again too soon. Wait three to six months before applying again. Your approval odds may be better with a different type of credit card. If you applied for a traditional credit card, consider applying for a secured credit card next time. Or, choose a student credit card if you're enrolled in a college or university. You may have to look at alternative ways to establish your credit history before you can be approved for a credit card. Alternative Ways to Build Credit A traditional credit card isn't the only option to build your credit. If you're having trouble getting approved, here are some other possibilities. Get an Alternative Credit Card Some newer fintech cards don't require a traditional credit history. Instead, the card issuer may look at your income and bank activity. These cards may operate more like charge cards, requiring you to pay your balance in full each month. The advantage is these cards often report to the major credit bureaus, helping you establish a credit history. However, features, fees and approval criteria can vary, so take time to compare options. Become an Authorized User A family member or friend can make you an authorized user on one of their credit cards. When you're added as an authorized user, the account's credit history is added to your credit report, establishing a credit history that can help you get approved for your own credit card. Tip: Be carefulâif the cardholder misses payments or carries a high balance, it will affect your credit too. For the best chances of benefiting your credit history with your authorized user status, choose someone with good credit and a positive history with the credit card. Get a Credit-Builder Loan When you get a credit-builder loan, the lender places the loan balance in a savings account and you make fixed monthly payments to pay off the loan balance. Loan amounts are typically smallâlike $1,000 or lessâand repayment terms range from six to 24 months. Once you're approved for a loan, your monthly payments are reported to the credit bureaus, which can help you build credit. At the end of the repayment term, you get the loan balance back plus any interest you've accrued. Learn more: Credit-Builder Loans vs. Secured Credit Cards: Which Is Better?

You can typically start with a secured, store or student credit card. If you have trouble getting approved, consider an alternative, like becoming an authorized user, to establish credit before applying for a traditional credit card. After six to 12 months of timely payments, you can check your FICOÂ® Score for free through Experian. From there, continue to check your credit regularly to see your progress and confirm your credit activity is reported accurately. Don ât apply blindly
