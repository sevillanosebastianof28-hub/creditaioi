What Is the Easiest Credit Card to Get With No Credit? Quick Answer The easiest credit cards to get with no credit history are often secured credit cards and cards that use alternative credit data to evaluate your eligibility. If you want to start building your credit history, a credit card can be a great way to accomplish your goal. However, your options will be somewhat limited, so it's important to know where to look. In general, the easiest credit card to get with no credit history is a secured card or a card that uses a nontraditional underwriting process to review your application. Here's what you need to know about your options. What Is the Easiest Credit Card to Get for Beginners? For many people, the main option is a secured credit card. Secured credit cards require an upfront security depositâusually equal to your credit limitâto act as collateral for any debt you incur with the card. That deposit is held in a separate account and can be seized if you fail to pay off charges you make with the card. If you use your secured credit card responsibly, some card issuers may opt to return your deposit after a period of several months and convert your account to an unsecured card. In other cases, however, you'll need to close your account to get your deposit back. In recent years, financial technology companies and even some major card issuers have begun to offer unsecured starter credit cards with nontraditional underwriting processes and structures that make it easier to get approved without a credit history.

Review the adverse action letter to get a better understanding of which areas of your credit history or overall financial situation you can address to improve your odds of getting approved the next time you apply. Alternatively, you can pursue other ways to build credit, including the following. Opt for a Nontraditional Credit Card You may be able to get approved for a credit card that doesn't focus on your credit history. Debit-credit hybrid cards may be another option, as they generally don't require a credit check when you apply. Get a Retail Credit Card Store credit cards offered by retailers and gas stations typically have less stringent credit requirements than traditional credit cards. If you shop regularly with a specific retailer, you can also take advantage of rewards, discounts, free shipping and other perks. That said, credit limits are usually low, so it can be easy to rack up a high credit utilization rate, which can hurt your credit.
