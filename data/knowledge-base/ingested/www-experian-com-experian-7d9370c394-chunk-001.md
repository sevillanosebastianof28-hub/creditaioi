How to Get a Secured Credit Card Quick Answer You can apply for a secured credit card by following these steps: If you have a low credit score or limited credit history, getting approved for a secured credit card can be easier than getting a traditional credit card. Unlike a traditional credit card, however, secured cards require an upfront security deposit. Here's more on how secured credit cards work and the steps you can take to apply for one. What Is a Secured Credit Card? A secured credit card is a type of card that requires you to provide a cash deposit as collateral when opening the account. Your deposit is typically equal to your credit limit. A secured card could be a good option for improving your credit if you're just starting out or have a low credit score. Because the issuer can use your deposit to recoup your balance should you default, issuers can be less restrictive when approving applications for secured cards. That could open the door to building credit, and you may be able to graduate to an unsecured card down the line. Who Qualifies for a Secured Credit Card? Depending on the card, you may be able to get approved for a secured credit card with a low credit score or no credit history at all. Some card issuers may be willing to work with you even if you have a bankruptcy on your credit reportâthough it typically needs to be discharged first. Keep in mind that the typical deposit is $200 or more. If you can afford to cover the upfront security deposit, a secured card could be a good option to get started buildingâor rebuildingâyour credit.
