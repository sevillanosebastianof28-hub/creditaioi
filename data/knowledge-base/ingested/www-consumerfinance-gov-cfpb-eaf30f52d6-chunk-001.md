Warning letters Sometimes the CFPB will send a warning letter to advise recipients that certain actions may violate federal consumer financial law. These are not accusations of wrongdoing. Instead, they are meant to help recipients review certain practices and ensure that they comply with federal law. If the CFPB determines that other entities might also benefit from a reminder to review certain practices or thinks the public should be aware of particular activities, it may make aspects of these letters public, but will not identify the recipients.
