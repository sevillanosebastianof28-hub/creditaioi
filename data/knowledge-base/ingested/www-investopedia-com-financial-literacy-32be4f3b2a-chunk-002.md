Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measurement of the value created through the goods and services produced in a particular country within a certain time frame. There are several types of GDP (e.g., nominal, real, per capita, etc.), all of which provide slightly different information about a country’s financial health. The law of supply and demand is an economic theory that defines the dynamic between the price of a good or service and a consumer’s willingness to purchase it. The theory posits that, all else being equal, the price of a good tends to increase when supply decreases or demand increases, and vice versa. In economics, inflation is a measurement of how much the prices of goods and services are rising within a specific economy. Inflation is intended to be reflective of the decreasing purchasing power of a specific currency for a diversified set of products and services. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measurement of the average change in how much consumers have paid for a basket of consumer goods and services within a specific time period. Reported on a monthly basis by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the CPI is one of the most popular tools for measuring inflation. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
