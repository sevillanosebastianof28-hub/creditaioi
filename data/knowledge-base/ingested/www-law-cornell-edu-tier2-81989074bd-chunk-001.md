Contact Before contacting us, please understand that we cannot provide legal advice or interpretations of the law. Doing so would constitute the practice of law, which is a licensed and regulated activity in all 50 states. If you need legal advice, you can find an attorney in our lawyer directory. You can also get some limited assistance from our friends at Justia. These links are provided as a convenience to LII users. Like the attorneys in our directory, Justia are separate entities not affiliated with LII or Cornell University. LII is not responsible for the services or information they provide. Web Accessibility For web accessibility help, please refer to the Accessibility policy. Media Requests The Legal Information Institute cannot and does not comment on the meaning of the law. Reporters wishing to speak to a legal expert on the faculty of the Cornell Law School may reach out to law-communications@cornell.edu.
