After all, your goal is to strengthen your household finances as a whole. Here are some ways to get on the same page. Prioritize good communication. It's easier to manage debt together when you're both clear on what each of you owe, including your balances, rates and due dates. Beyond disclosing your debts, discuss your long-term financial goals. This can help you both focus on and work toward your vision as a team. - Budget together. A budget is key for managing the debt you already have, and for avoiding extra debt in the future. Consider using a budgeting app that allows you to track your income and expenses as a couple. - Agree on how you'll pay off debts. Work together to list all your debts in one place, then decide how you'll prioritize them. Look into the debt snowball and debt avalanche methods, which help you rank and handle your debts one by one. - Plan for emergencies. If you don't have a safety net, then you're likely to rely on debt in an emergency, such as a reduction in income or sudden unplanned expense. An emergency fund can help. Aim to set aside enough to cover three to six months' worth of expenses in a savings account. - Consider credit counseling. Getting advice from an expert can be helpful if you and your spouse want to get aligned but aren't sure where to start. If you're feeling overwhelmed by your debts and need help coming up with a plan for managing your money, a nonprofit credit counselor may be able to help. - Monitor your credit. Regardless of your state's laws, it's beneficial to regularly monitor your credit to keep an eye on all accounts you're named on and be aware of how you and your spouse's actions impact your credit score. - Learn more: How to Get Your Spouse on Board With Paying Off Debt The Bottom Line In most states, getting married won't pool together your individual debts; what you owe on your own remains your obligation, and the same applies to your spouse. In specific states, applicable laws may mean that getting married does assign you some legal responsibility for the balances your spouse owes. Be sure to understand what laws apply in your state so that each of you enter your marriage with a clear financial picture. Wherever you live, the way you manage debt together as a couple can impact you both. Remember that if you share loans or credit cards with your spouse, you're both equally on the hook. Should your spouse make poor decisions, like carrying too high of a balance or missing bills, it can impact your credit too. Whatâs on your credit report?
