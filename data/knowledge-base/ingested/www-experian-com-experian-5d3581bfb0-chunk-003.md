credit scores are calculated at the moment they're requested, your scores can differ because of changes in your credit reportâeven from hour to hour. - You may also have different credit scores if you're comparing one of your FICOÂ® Scores to a VantageScore credit score. What Is My Real Credit Score? There is no single "real" credit score. Companies can choose which credit scores to use when reviewing applications and managing customers' accounts, and you won't necessarily know which score a company will use ahead of time. Example: When you're shopping for an auto loan, you may try to get offers from several lenders. One lender might use a FICOÂ® Score 9, another a FICO Auto Score 10 and a third a VantageScore 4.0. Your scores may vary, but each is very real in the sense that the lender is using it to determine if you qualify for a loan and the rates and terms to offer you. Because most credit scores rely on the same underlying data, building positive credit can help you get good credit scores regardless of the model. Conversely, negative items, such as late payments or a bankruptcy, could hurt all of your credit scores.
