Except for Supreme Court decisions, almost no decisions from any court dating from before 1990 are available from any free source on the Net. Other hard-to-find categories are cases from the Federal District Courts, state courts other than the highest appellate court in the state, and all manner of county and municipal courts. There are exceptions, though, and new things are coming online constantly. One way to find them is to search on the name of the court in Google Scholar, Court Listener, or the Caselaw Access Project - When you can't find a Supreme Court case you read about in the news. News media are fond of saying that the Supreme Court "ruled" or "made a decision" in a case when in fact all the Court did was refuse to hear an appeal from a lower court ruling (in such cases the Court is said to have "denied certiorari"). The effect, of course, is to let the ruling of the lower court stand. Often this is reported as a decision by the Court, but the decision is simply to let things remain as the lower court left them. Denials of certiorari are reported in the order lists handed down by the Court on most Mondays during the term, and are listed by case name. We have recently added a feature that allows you to search the order lists for particular cases. Help with legal problems and procedures As we mention in the introductory section of this page, the LII cannot and does not provide legal advice or interpretation of law; we cannot legally do so. A later section of this page talks about ways to find an attorney; you probably also want to look at the section on finding rules, regulations, statutes, and cases. Most communities have legal assistance available for people who cannot afford an attorney. Some things people frequently ask about: Matrimonial law and child custody - We provide topical guides in the areas of adoption, child custody, children's rights, divorce, and marriage law. You may also want to look at Divorce HelpLine, DivorceNet, and DivorceSource. Bankruptcy law. - We provide a topical overview of bankruptcy and of debtor-creditor law. You should also look at the laws of your state. Employment law (including discrimination, unemployment, worker's compensation, and collective bargaining - See our general guide to employment law. In many cases the laws of your state be an important follow-up resource. Copyright law and procedures. - We provide an overview of copyright law that points to most important Internet resources. The Library of Congress offers an excellent guide to basic copyright, including registration procedures. Landlord-tenant problems. - Again, we offer a topical guide. Much depends on the law of your state, and depending on the nature of the dispute, on county and municipal regulations as well. The TenantNet site is useful, but oriented toward New York City people and problems. - Finding a lawyer Check our Lawyer Directory to help locate a lawyer who can help you. The ABA maintains an extensive information about programs that provide legal services to people who cannot otherwise afford an attorney. Contacting government agencies and officials A good overview of how government agencies are organized is provided by the US Government Manual and USA.gov A-Z Index of U.S. Government Departments and Agencies. In addition, most of the large Net directory services offer special sections on government. The offering from Infospace is particularly nice. Bringing resources to the attention of the LII We appreciate it when people take the trouble to notify us of newly available legal-information resources; use the "suggestions" category in the contact form. Our listing of and linking to other legal resources is governed by our judgment about the usefulness and quality of the content they provide. We do not attempt to be comprehensive and we are not a
