Can I Get a Credit Card After Bankruptcy? Quick Answer You can get a credit card after bankruptcy, but damage to your credit scores may limit your options. If you canât qualify for a traditional card, a secured card could be a good choice. It's possibleâand advisableâto get a credit card after bankruptcy, although your options may be limited by your credit scores and card issuers' qualification standards. Read on to find how bankruptcy affects your ability to get credit cards and what you can do about it. How Bankruptcy Affects Credit Bankruptcy may be the single most severe negative entry that can appear on your credit reports. It will lower your credit scores for as long as it remains, although its impact will lessen over time. How long it takes to expire depends on the type of bankruptcy protection you seek. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy, in which you surrender property in exchange for eliminating many debts, stays on your credit report for up to 10 years. - A Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which establishes a three- or five-year payment plan for making full or partial restitution to your creditors, remains on your credit report for up to seven years. - After you file for bankruptcy, your creditors may recoup only a fraction of the money you owe them (or none at all), so that can make other lenders wary of working with you. Some lenders turn down any applicant with a bankruptcy on their credit report. Others consider applicants with older bankruptcy entries but may charge high interest rates and fees. How to Get a Credit Card After Bankruptcy Check your credit reports. Check your credit report at one or all three national credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) to keep aware of the many credit updates that coincide with bankruptcy, and to check for accuracy. For example, within three to six months after you file bankruptcy, it should appear on your credit reports, and any accounts discharged through bankruptcy should update within a few months to show zero balances. If you see any inaccuracies on one of your credit reports, you have the right to dispute it and have the report corrected. - Check your credit score. You can check your credit scores for free from a variety of sources, including Experian. Doing so can give you an idea where you stand when researching credit cards' approval requirements. - Look for cards that target borrowers with less-than-ideal credit. Struggles preceding bankruptcy often include missed debt payments, accounts placed in collections, and other events that can pull credit scores down to the poor range even before the blow of bankruptcy. If this is your situation, you'll need to look for credit card offers aimed at applicants with lower credit scores. These cards often come with relatively high interest rates and fees, but if you pay your balance in full each month, you can avoid finance charges. - Use prequalification to gauge likelihood of acceptance. Each time you apply for a credit card, a credit check known as a hard inquiry appears on your credit report and typically lowers your credit scores by a few points. To avoid multiple reductions to your already-depressed scores, take advantage of the free prequalification option offered by many card issuers. This process lets you know if you're likely to qualify for a given card and, if so, how large a borrowing limit you're likely to get. An affirmative prequalification isn't a guaranteeâyou'll need to submit a full application to get a final decisionâbut if you're declined at the prequalifying stage, you can save the trouble of applying and racking up a hard inquiry. Experian's card comparison tool can show you which cards you may qualify for based on your credit profile. - Consider a secured credit card. If you don't qualify for a traditional credit
