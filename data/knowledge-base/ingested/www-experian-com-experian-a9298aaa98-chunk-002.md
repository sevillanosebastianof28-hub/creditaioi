bill on time. This helps establish that you can handle credit wisely. Remember that even one late payment can hurt the credit score that you're trying so hard to establish. To ensure you never miss a payment date, it's a good idea to set up automatic payments for at least the minimum amount due each month. Become an Authorized User If you have family members who are responsible credit users with good credit scores, getting added to one of their credit card accounts is a good way to start building credit. Some parents choose to add their teenage or college age children as an authorized user on their credit cards to give them a head start before they can get a card of their own. To get the most benefit from being an authorized user, see if you can be added to an account that has been open for a long time, that the primary cardholder always pays on time, and that has a low credit utilization ratio (meaning less than 30% of the total available credit on the card is being used). Once you're an authorized user, you can make purchases on the card, and the account will appear on your credit report. You'll benefit from the good credit history the primary cardholder has already built up with that card. However, it works the other way too: If the primary cardholder is late with a payment, the account could be dropped from your credit file, which will negate any positive effect it was providing. Being an authorized user is sort of like training wheels for having your own credit card. The primary cardholder is ultimately responsible for all charges on the card. However, you should always strive to pay for your own charges; this will help you develop good credit and budgeting habits (and stay in good standing with the primary user). Always Make Payments on Time Once you have a credit card, make sure to pay your bill on time every month. Your payment history is the single most important factor in your credit score, accounting for 35% of your FICOÂ® ScoreÎ (the credit scoring model most lenders use). Keeping your credit utilization ratio low is another way to build good credit. This ratio refers to the percentage of your available credit you're using. If your credit card has a limit of $200 and you're carrying a balance of $100, you're using 50% of your available credit. Maintaining a credit utilization ratio below 30% of your credit limit (or better yet, below 10%) will help to boost your credit score. Paying your balance in full each month helps tooâand will also prevent you from accruing interest on your purchases. Do you have any outstanding student loans? Paying those bills on time can help improve your credit score. Student loans are installment credit, while credit cards are revolving credit. Having a mix of both types of credit helps to increase your credit score.
