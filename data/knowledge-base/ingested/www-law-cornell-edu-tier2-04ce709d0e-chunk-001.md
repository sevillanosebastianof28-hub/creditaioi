Executive Orders of the President of the United States are declarations with the force of law, which can take effect without the intervention of Congress. They are typically signed, then published on the White House website (usually after several hours), then formally published (usually a few days later) in the Federal Register. (You can read more about executive orders in general in Wex and about distinctions between executive orders, proclamations, and memoranda from the Library of Congress.) Below are recent executive orders we are pointing to in advance of their publication in the Federal Register.
