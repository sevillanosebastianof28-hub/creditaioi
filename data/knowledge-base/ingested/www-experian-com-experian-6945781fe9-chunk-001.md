Can You Buy a Car With a Debit Card? Quick Answer Buying a car with a debit card is possible if the dealer accepts it and your bank approves the transaction. However, itâs important to consider the dealerâs policies, transaction limits and your own cash flow needs. Some dealerships accept debit cards as payment for cars, but often only for partial payments or with transaction limits. Using a debit card to pay for a car could also deplete your available cash and conflict with financial goals like saving for a house. Here's what to know if you're considering buying a car with a debit card. Can I Buy a Car With a Debit Card? A debit card is a payment card linked to your bank account. When you use a debit card to make a purchase, the money is immediately taken from your account to complete the transaction. You can buy a car with a debit card if the dealership allows itâas long as you have enough money in your bank account and the purchase amount is within your bank's daily debit card spending limits. Banks typically cap debit card purchases at $2,000 to $7,000 per day to protect cardholders whose debit cards are lost or stolen. Your limits may be higher or lower depending on your bank policies and account type. If your limit isn't high enough to buy a car, you can contact your bank to see if they'll temporarily increase your debit card purchase limit. Even if you have sufficient funds in your account, banks sometimes decline transactions for large or unusual purchases to protect you against debit card fraud. Calling the bank a few days before the purchase with the approximate amount, dealership name and address can help ensure the transaction is approved. In addition to bank limitations, dealerships may also cap the amount they'll accept via debit card. For example, some dealers may accept a down payment or deposit via debit card but request a cashier's check for the balance of the purchase. Before visiting the dealership, contact the financing department to confirm they accept debit card payments and any limits on amounts. Tip: To ensure you have enough in your bank account to pay for a car, remember to include dealership fees, sales taxes, vehicle registration fees and other charges in addition to the sales price. Check your available balance before heading to the dealership. Learn more: Credit Card vs. Debit Card: How Are They Different?
