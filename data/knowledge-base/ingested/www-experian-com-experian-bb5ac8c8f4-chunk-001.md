Should You Bundle Your Home and Auto Insurance? Quick Answer Buying homeowners insurance and auto insurance can be a good idea if doing so will save you money while providing the coverage you need. Bundling can also make it easier to manage your insurance payments. Home and auto insurance provide peace of mind, but high insurance premiums can leave you feeling financially frazzled. Bundling your home and auto insurance can help you save money and make it easier to manage your insurance policies. Bundling means buying two or more insurance policies from the same insurance company. Home and auto insurance are frequently bundled types of coverage, likely because bundling these policies typically generates big savings. However, you may also be able to bundle life insurance, renters insurance, condo insurance or insurance for motorcycles and boats. These other combinations can save you money too. Compare: Car Insurance Quotes Benefits of Bundling Your Home and Auto Insurance There are several potential benefits to bundling your home and car insurance. May Lower Your Premiums Most insurance companies offer discounts for purchasing multiple insurance policies. Also known as a multi-policy or multi-line discount, having more than one policy with the same insurer can mean significant savings. For example, Progressive says new customers can save more than 20% on average by bundling home and auto insurance. State Farm cites average savings of $1,073 annually. That's a nice chunk of money you could put toward financial goals such as saving for your emergency fund, retirement or a big vacation. Simplifies Account Management Missing an insurance premium payment could cause your coverage to lapse, leaving your home or car unprotected. Choosing one insurance company for both homeowners and car insurance streamlines account management so you're less likely to forget a payment due date. With bundled coverage, you can set up just one account, download one company's mobile app and schedule automatic bill payments in one place. (Bonus: Automatic payments may earn you additional discounts.) If you have a claim involving both your car and your home, you can deal with a single insurance carrier and agent to get them resolved. You Could Save on Deductibles Sometimes a covered event damages both your home and your carâfor instance, a tree branch falls on your roof before hitting your car. If you have bundled home and auto insurance, some insurance companies charge you only one deductible for such events. With policies from two separate insurers, you'd be on the hook for two separate deductibles. Disadvantages of Bundling Your Home and Auto Insurance There are also a few drawbacks to bundling home and car insurance. You May Not Find the Plan You Need If you have specialized insurance needs, there may not be one insurer that offers the combination of home and auto coverage you want. For example, if you have a record of unsafe driving, your best bet for car insurance might be a company that specializes in high-risk drivers and doesn't offer home insurance. Similarly, homeowners in wildfire zones may need to turn to state insurance pools or surplus line insurance carriers that don't sell car insurance. Separate Policies Might Be Cheaper Although bundling home and auto insurance typically reduces your premiums, it doesn't always deliver the biggest savings. Discounts for bundling home and auto insurance can vary widely depending on your location, the insurance carrier and other factors. For instance, Allstate reports that the average customer saves 25% by bundling, but says its customers in California save just 2% on average. Bundling isn't the only way to earn insurance discounts either. You might receive car insurance discounts for getting good grades, taking a defensive driving course or having an alternative-fuel vehicle. Home insurance carriers might give discounts for retirees or for installing devices such as burglar alarms to help reduce risk. Switching to a different insurance provider
