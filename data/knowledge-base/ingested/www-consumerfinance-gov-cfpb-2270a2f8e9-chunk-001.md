Credit and consumer reporting complaint notice THIS CONSUMER COMPLAINT PORTAL IS DESIGNED TO HELP CONSUMERS, INCLUDING TO RESOLVE COMPLAINTS AGAINST CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES. CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW, CONSUMERS MUST FIRST DISPUTE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE INFORMATION ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT WITH THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY. PREMATURE SUBMISSIONS SLOW DOWN THE SYSTEM FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED OF HELP AND WHO HAVE CORRECTLY FOLLOWED THE PROCESS. HAVE YOU SUBMITTED YOUR DISPUTE TO A CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY MORE THAN 45 DAYS AGO, OR IS YOUR DISPUTE WITH THEM NO LONGER PENDING? IF NOT, DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR COMPLAINT HERE AT THIS TIME.
