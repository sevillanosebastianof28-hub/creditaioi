Hello, how can we help? What should I do if I think someone is using my personal information? Where can I find out more about identity theft and protecting my identity? What is identity theft? What should I do if I was previously issued a 10-digit security freeze PIN? Can I lock my Equifax credit report if I have a security freeze? What's the difference between a credit report lock and a security freeze? Why can't I lock my Equifax credit report when it's frozen? How do I replace a security freeze with a lock on my Equifax credit report? How secure is the information I provide to Equifax.com? Can Equifax assist consumers who are deaf or hard of hearing? What is a security freeze? What are the security freeze fees? Am I better off placing a fraud alert, requesting a security freeze, or obtaining a credit report lock? How do I place a security freeze on an incapacitated adult's or minor's Equifax credit report? Who can view my Equifax credit report if I have a security freeze or credit report lock? If I don't create a myEquifax account, are there other ways I can place a security freeze, fraud alert or active duty alert? What rights do I have under the Fair Credit Reporting Act if I have been a victim of ID theft? What documentation should I send in to validate my ID or address? How do I place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze?
