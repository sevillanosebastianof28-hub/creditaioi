We use our budget ($425.7 million in FY 2025) to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive conduct by businesses and to promote competition in the marketplace. The budget supports our strategic plan, which is the roadmap we follow to allocate and manage our resources. For more context about our budget, see related documents such as budget requests to Congress and annual reports on our finances and performance results.
