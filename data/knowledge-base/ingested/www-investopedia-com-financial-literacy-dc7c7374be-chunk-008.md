not touching it until you're allowed to withdraw it. Fully predictable earnings and withdrawal date: Because you know the CD's rate and term, you can calculate exactly how much you'll earn and when you can withdraw the funds without penalty. Extremely safe, with almost no bank or market risk: When you open a CD at an FDIC bank or an NCUA credit union, up to $250,000 in deposits are federally protected against the institution's failure. You're also safe from the market volatility—and potential loss in value—that can occur with stock and bond investments. Can deter spending temptations: Withdrawing funds before your CD matures causes you to pay an early withdrawal penalty, which can help keep you from giving in to temptations to dip into your savings for an unplanned purchase. This means a CD could be good for building your emergency fund. Cons Early withdrawal of the funds incurs a penalty: If you do need to withdraw your CD funds before maturity, the bank or credit union will impose an early withdrawal penalty. Typically, it's calculated as a certain number of months of forfeited interest earnings. You can’t add to your deposit: With the rare exception of add-on CDs, you can only deposit funds into the certificate at the time of initial deposit. This means you miss out on compound interest since you're not able to grow the account and apply the interest rate to your new balance every month like with a savings account. If CD rates rise, you may miss out on a higher yield: If you lock in your CD rate, but rates increase shortly after, you may wish you'd waited to score a higher return. If CD rates drop, you may wish you’d chosen a longer CD: Though you'll still be well-served by any CD yield you have locked in before interest rates drop, you may wish you'd locked in a longer-term CD to extend that competitive yield for a longer period. Typically return less than stocks over long periods: Though stock investments involve more risk and less predictability, they may offer greater returns over long periods. How to Choose the Best CD for You When choosing a CD, consider the following factors: Your financial goals: Both short-term goals and long-term goals are important.How much money you have to deposit: CDs have minimums, so if you only have $500 to deposit, you'll need to find a CD with that minimum balance requirement.How long you can leave that money in the CD without touching it: This will help you determine the right term—whether that's a one-year CD or a three-year CD.Interest rates offered for your term and minimum deposit: The higher the rate, the more you will earn on your deposit during the CD term.CD type: Is it a bump-up CD or a regular CD? This will ensure you're choosing one that meets your needs and goals. Once you choose a CD, open the account, and deposit your money to start earning interest. Christine DiGangi, Investopedia Product Reviews Team I had two short-term savings goals, so I looked for a 6-month and a 1-year CD with a high APY that I could ladder. I checked out a few of the options on our list and decided to go with CIT Bank and Bread Savings, because applying for the CDs online was really easy, and they offered mobile apps—I’m one of those people who checks their financial accounts frequently, if not daily. I’d keep accounts with both of them (assuming the rates are good when the two terms end). What Do You Need to Open One of the Best CDs?
