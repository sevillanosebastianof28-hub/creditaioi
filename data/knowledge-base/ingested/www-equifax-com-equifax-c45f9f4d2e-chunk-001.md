To opt out of such pre-approved offers, visit www.optoutprescreen.com. Under certain circumstances, access to your Equifax Credit Report may not be available as certain consumer credit files maintained by Equifax contain credit histories, multiple trade accounts, and/or an extraordinary number of inquiries of a nature that prevents or delays the delivery of your Equifax Credit Report. If a remedy for the failure is not available, the product subscription will be cancelled and a full refund will be made.
