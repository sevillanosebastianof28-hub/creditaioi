not we have an advertiser in place does not change the placement of the button or whether there's a link for you to go to their website. Example of a broker review with a product card featuring an Open Account button, for which we may receive compensation when you click it or if you sign up for the product. Comparison/Rate Tables Featuring Advertisers On some review/recommendations we may include a comparison table of products that are offers from advertisers. While we do work hard with partners to try and surface the best paid offers possible in these comparison tables, it's important to note that they are NOT editorially selected. Here's an example of what that can look like, notice the Advertising Disclosure link in the top right corner: Comparison tables featuring advertisers will always have their own Advertising Disclosure on them. Display Ads Some review/recommendations may include display advertising on them, which will be labelled as advertisements and are easily recognized. Example of traditional display advertisements on a bank review.
