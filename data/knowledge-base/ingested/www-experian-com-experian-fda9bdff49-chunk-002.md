Instantly raise your credit scoresÃ¸ How Long Do Collections Stay on Your Credit Reports? Whether you pay them or not, collection accounts are removed from your credit report seven years from the date your debt to the original creditor first became delinquent. Generally, creditors report your missed payment to the credit bureaus after one billing cycle (usually 30 days) passes without a payment. When the creditor gives up on collecting from youâtypically after 120 days without paymentâthey may sell your debt to a collection agency. If that collection agency can't collect either, they may resell your debt to another agency. Ultimately, your credit report could show several collection accounts, all originating from the same unpaid debt. Example: May 1: Your personal loan payment is 31 days late; your account is now delinquent. - September 2: The lender charges off your account, reducing the balance to $0, and sells the debt to Collection Agency A. A new collection account shows up on your credit report. - January 4: Collection Agency A still hasn't collected payment and resells your debt to Collection Agency B. - There are now two collection accounts on your credit report. Fortunately, you don't have to wait seven years from September 2 for the first account to drop off and seven years from January 4 for the second one to disappear. Since all the collection accounts are related to the same original debt, they'll all drop off your credit report seven years from May 1âthe date the original debt became delinquent. How to Remove Inaccurate Collections From Your Credit Report What if a collection account remains on your credit report as "unpaid" several months after you paid it? Here's how to remove inaccurate collections information from your credit report. 1. File a Dispute With the Credit Reporting Agency First, you have the right to file a dispute with the relevant credit bureau. Here's how: Dispute Method | Experian | TransUnion | Equifax | ---|---|---|---| Online | Dispute website | Dispute website | Dispute website | ---|---|---|---| By mail | ExperianP.O.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has guidance for filing disputes and a template you can use to write letters. Keep copies of any documents you send. 2. Contact the Collection Agency Next, you have the right to contact the collection agency to dispute the incorrect information. If they agree there's an error, they're responsible for sending correct information to the credit bureaus. If the collection agency determines that they aren't in error, you have the right to ask the credit bureau to include a statement of dispute in your credit report, explaining that you dispute the collection account and why. 3. Contact the Original Creditor In some cases, you may need to contact the creditor who sold your debt to the collection agency in the first place. If they determine the debt went to collections by mistake, they can contact the collection agency and try to resolve the issue. How to Improve Your Credit When You Have Collections Accurate collection accounts can't be removed from your credit reports until they legitimately expire in seven years.
