A fraud alert is a notice on your credit report that alerts creditors you are or may be a victim of fraud, including identity theft. A fraud alert can make it harder for someone to open unauthorized accounts in your name. It encourages or requires lenders and creditors to take extra steps to verify your identity, such as contacting you by phone, before opening a new credit account in your name or making changes to existing accounts. There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report, and both are free. Initial fraud alert - If you believe you are or may become a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may place an initial fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert remains on your credit report for one year, unless you choose to remove it sooner, and can be renewed for additional one-year periods. An initial fraud alert also allows you to request an additional free copy of your credit reports from the three nationwide credit bureaus during the 12-month period following the placement of the initial fraud alert. - Extended fraud alert - If you have a police report showing you’re a victim of identity theft, you may place an extended fraud alert on your credit report. An extended fraud alert remains on your credit report for seven years unless you choose to remove it sooner. An extended fraud alert also allows you to request two free credit reports from the three nationwide credit bureaus during the 12-month period following the placement of the extended fraud alert, and your name is removed from pre-screened credit card and insurance offers for 5 years. - You can contact any of the three nationwide credit bureaus to request a fraud alert. Once you have placed a fraud alert on your credit report with one of the bureaus, that bureau will send a request to the other two bureaus to do the same, so you do not have to contact all three.
