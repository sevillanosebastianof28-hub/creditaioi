Understanding your credit scores is an important part of getting a better understanding of your credit reports. A credit score is a three-digit number, typically between 300 and 850, which is designed to represent your credit risk, or the likelihood you will pay your bills on time. In general, a higher credit score represents a higher likelihood of responsible financial habits. Financial services companies tend to group borrowers into segments according to their credit score. These credit score ranges may help determine how much you’ll be charged, the interest rate you will pay on your mortgage, student loan, or automobile loan, or the type of credit card you’ll be offered. Credit scores are calculated using the content of your credit report. Each of the three nationwide credit bureaus uses a slightly different method of determining your score. There are many different credit scoring companies and credit scoring models, or differing methods of calculating credit scores. Two of the biggest companies when it comes to credit scoring models are FICO and VantageScore. VantageScore is the result of a collaboration between the three nationwide credit bureaus – Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.
