your next purchase. You can also access your equity through a cash-out refinance loan if you need funds but want to keep the car. Lower Costs Over Time After paying off your auto loan, your only expenses are maintenance and repairs, assuming you don't replace the vehicle and loan with new ones. You can drive the vehicle for years without the ongoing costs associated with continuous leasing. You also avoid end-of-lease fees for mileage overages or excessive wear and tear. Drawbacks of Buying a Car While buying can save you money long term, it comes with higher short-term costs and additional financial risks. Here are the key disadvantages to consider. Higher Upfront Costs Buying a car typically requires a more substantial down payment than leasingâoften 10% to 20% of the purchase price. If you're short on cash or don't want to drain your savings, securing a loan with favorable terms may be challenging. Higher Monthly Payments and Repair Costs Auto loan payments are generally higher than lease payments since you're financing the vehicle's full purchase price. Additionally, if you keep the car for several years, you'll face increasing maintenance and repair costsâespecially once the manufacturer's warranty expires.

If your car's value drops faster than you pay down your loan, you could end up owing more than the vehicle is worth. This negative equity becomes a problem if the car is totaled in an accident or repossessedâyou'll need to pay the lender the difference in a lump sum. Is It Cheaper to Lease or Buy a Car? In the short term, leasing is generally cheaper due to lower down payment requirements, reduced monthly payments and minimal maintenance costs. According to Experian's State of the Automotive Finance Market Report for the third quarter of 2025, the average lease payment was $596 per month, while the average payment on a new car loan was $748. Leasing remains a popular option, particularly for higher-end vehicles. For example, while roughly 23% of all new vehicles are leased, that percentage jumps to nearly 57% for electric vehicles (EVs). If you want to try an EV but aren't sure if you want to commit long term, a lease can be a better option. Over the long term, though, buying can save you more money because you retain all the equity you build as you pay down the loan. Once you pay off the debt, you own the car outright and eliminate monthly payments entirely. Ultimately, the cheaper option depends on how often you replace your vehicles. To estimate costs for your specific situation, consider using an online leasing versus buying calculator. Is It Better to Lease or Buy a Car? The right choice between leasing and buying depends on your financial priorities, driving habits and lifestyle preferences. Neither option is universally better, and what works best for you comes down to how you use your vehicle and what you value most. When It May Be Better to Lease a Car You want a new car every few years. Leasing allows you to drive the latest models with updated technology and safety features without the hassle of selling or trading in your vehicle. - You prefer lower monthly payments. Since you're only paying for the vehicle's depreciation during the lease term, monthly lease payments are typically lower than loan payments for the same vehicle. - You want minimal maintenance costs. New leased vehicles are usually covered by the manufacturer's warranty throughout the lease term, keeping repair costs low or nonexistent. - You drive 12,000 to 15,000 miles or less annually. Most leases include mileage limits in this range. If your commute is short or you don't take frequent road trips, you can stay within these restrictions without extra fees.
