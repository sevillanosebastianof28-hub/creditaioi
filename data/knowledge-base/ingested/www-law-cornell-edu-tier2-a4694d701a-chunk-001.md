Our People Founded in 1992 by a law professor and a technologist, LII’s biggest strength remains its interdisciplinary approach. Decades later, our small staff still reflects that split of expertise between legal and technical training. Our team draws from their disparate experiences in everything from library services and legal practice to legal publishing (government and commercial) and tech start-ups. This diversity of experience and perspective leaves us not only open to dreaming up unique solutions but also uniquely equipped to make those dreams become reality.
