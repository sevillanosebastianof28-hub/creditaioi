How to Pay Off Credit Card Debt Quick Answer You can pay off credit card debt by choosing a debt payoff strategy, such as the debt avalanche or snowball method, a balance transfer credit card or a debt consolidation loan. Using credit cards regularly can be a great way to build your credit history and take advantage of rewards and benefits along the way. But overspending and unexpected financial challenges can result in a mountain of credit card debt. On average, U.S. consumers have $6,730 in credit card debt as of the third quarter of 2024, according to Experian data. You can start paying off your credit card debt by tallying up how much you owe and listing the balance and interest rate for each card. Once you have an idea of the amount you're dealing with, consider trying one of the strategies below to pay down your credit card debt. 1. Debt Snowball Method The debt snowball approach is an accelerated payoff strategy that can save you both time and money. To get started, make the minimum payment on all of your credit cards. Then, apply any extra funds you can afford to the card with the lowest balance. Once you've paid off that card, add the amount you were putting toward it to the minimum payment on the card with the next-lowest balance. You'll keep doing this with each card, creating a snowball effect that could help you shave time off your repayment plan and save hundreds or even thousands of dollars on interest. Example: If you have debt on credit cards with a $3,000 and $7,000 balance, you'd work on paying off the card with the $3,000 balance first. The debt snowball approach is best for people who struggle to stay motivated and need quick wins early on in the process. 2. Debt Avalanche Method Like the debt snowball strategy, the debt avalanche method has you focus on knocking out accounts one by one. The key difference is the avalanche method targets the balances with the highest interest rates first, regardless of which has the lower balance. Example: If you have debt on credit cards with a 25% APR and 19% APR, you'd focus on paying off the card with the 25% APR first. Compared with the debt snowball method, the debt avalanche method may not give you early wins. For example, if the card with the highest annual percentage rate (APR) also has a high balance, it can take a long time before you pay off the first credit card. But it could help you save more money by eliminating your most expensive debts first. 3. Balance Transfer Credit Card If your credit is in good shape, a balance transfer credit card could be a good fit. These cards typically offer an introductory 0% APR for a set period of timeâtypically 12 to 21 months, depending on the cardâduring which you can pay down your debt interest-free. There's typically an upfront balance transfer fee of 3% to 5% of the transfer amount, which is added to your new balance, but the interest savings can still be worth it. If you have multiple balances, consolidating them with a balance transfer can also simplify your monthly payments. Keep in mind, though, that there's no guarantee you'll get a high enough credit limit on the new card to cover the amount you want to pay off, and maxing out the balance transfer card could result in your credit score going down, at least temporarily, until you can pay down the debt and reduce your credit utilization. Tip: Continue to make payments on your old credit card until the balance transfer is complete. 4. Debt Consolidation Loan A debt consolidation loan is a personal loan you use to pay off credit card debt. Unlike credit cards, personal loans have a
