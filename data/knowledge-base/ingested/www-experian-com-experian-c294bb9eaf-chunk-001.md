How to Temporarily Lift a Security Freeze Quick Answer You can temporarily lift a security freeze by logging in to your account with each credit bureau or contacting them by phone or mail. You will need to do this when applying for new credit. A security freeze on your credit report is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from identity theft and unauthorized credit applications. However, there are times when you'll need to temporarily or permanently lift that freeze to allow legitimate access to your credit file. You can temporarily lift a security freeze by logging in to your account with each credit bureau and specifying the time period you want to grant access, or you can remove the freeze entirely through the same online process. How to Temporarily Lift a Security Freeze The quickest and most convenient way to temporarily lift your Experian security freeze is through your online account. Here are some easy-to-follow steps: Start by visiting the credit freeze center and either logging in to your existing account or registering for a new one. - Click on "Schedule a thaw," and then "Add a thaw." - Select a date range for your temporary lift and click on "Schedule thaw." - Confirm the dates and either log out or remove the thaw to correct or update the date range. - Alternatively, you can call 888-397-3742 to speak with a representative or send a written request to: Experian Security Freeze P.O. Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013 Note that written requests should include the following information, with documentation showing your name, current mailing address and issue date: Your full name - Social Security number - Complete addresses for the past two years - Date of birth - A copy of a government-issued ID, such as a driver's license - Copy of a utility bill or bank statement - Since creditors may look at more than one of your credit reports, it's recommended that you lift your security freeze with all three credit bureaus. Here's how you can do that: Online | Phone | ---|---| Experian | Experian Freeze Center | 888-397-3742 | Experian Security FreezeP.O.

Simply log in to your account and select the option to permanently remove the freeze rather than temporarily lifting it. Again, this is the best and quickest method to accomplish your goal. While you can also call or mail a request to permanently remove your security freeze, these methods require additional personal information and verification steps, which can take longer to process. This isn't ideal if you need immediate access to your credit file for time-sensitive applications like mortgage preapproval or urgent credit decisions. When to Lift a Security Freeze There are several common scenarios when you'll need to temporarily or permanently lift your security freeze: Applying for new credit: Whether you're applying for a credit card, personal loan, auto loan or mortgage, lenders will need access to your credit report to make their decision. - Getting preapproved for major purchases: Mortgage and auto loan preapprovals require lenders to review your credit history. Having your freeze lifted in advance can speed up the preapproval process. - Opening new accounts: Some banks and credit unions may check your credit when you open checking or savings accounts. - Signing up for services: You may need to unfreeze your credit when getting an internet plan, cellphone contract or utility services.
