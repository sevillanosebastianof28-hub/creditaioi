go back to where it was within one or two months, all else being equal. Tip: Consistently making installment loan payments on time can help improve your credit score. A paid-off loan stays on your credit report for up to 10 years after the account closes, which continues to benefit your credit score if the account was in good standing.

As you pay off debt accounts, it helps to understand how your credit score is calculated and how your actions may affect it. These are the top credit scoring factors to be aware of: Payment History: 35% The most important factor, accounting for 35% of your FICOÂ® ScoreÎ, payment history reflects whether you pay your bills on time. A single payment over 30 days late stays on your credit report for seven years and can negatively affect your credit score. Amounts Owed: 30% Accounting for 30% of your FICOÂ® Score, this factor indicates how much you owe on loans and your credit utilization rate on revolving credit. You can calculate your credit utilization by dividing your outstanding balance on each revolving account by its credit limit, then multiplying by 100 to see the result as a percentage. Example: You have a credit card with a $20,000 limit and a $5,000 balance. Your credit utilization rate on that credit card, then, is 25%: (5,000 / 20,000) x 100 = 25. Length of Credit History: 15% The age of your credit accounts determines 15% of your FICOÂ® Score. Credit scoring models consider factors such as the age of your oldest credit account, newest credit account and the average age of all your accounts. The longer you've had credit accounts in good standing, the better. Credit Mix: 10% Having a mix of revolving and installment credit accounts is less important to your credit score than some other factors, but it accounts for 10% of your FICOÂ® Score, which can still make a difference. For example, if you've only had installment loans (such as student loans or auto loans), opening a credit card account can improve your credit mix. That doesn't mean you should open a new account solely for this purpose, however. It's generally best to apply for new credit only when you need it. New Credit: 10% When you apply for a new loan or line of credit, a hard inquiry appears on your credit report, which can temporarily lower your score a few points. Approximately 10% of your FICOÂ® Score factors in how many new accounts you've recently opened and how many hard inquiries you have. An increase in those activities can make you appear risky to lenders. Tip: One exception when applying for new credit is rate shopping for the best installment loan, such as a car loan or mortgage. Credit scoring models see rate shopping as a good practice, so they treat these loan applications as a single hard inquiry if they are completed in a short time frame, two weeks to be safest. This minimizes credit score impact while also helping you find the best deal.
