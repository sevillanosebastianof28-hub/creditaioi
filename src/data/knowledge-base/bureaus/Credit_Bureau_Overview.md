## 2. BUREAU ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES

### 2.1 Data Collection
Bureaus collect information from:
- Creditors (credit cards, loans, mortgages)
- Collection agencies
- Public records
- Court filings
- Consumer-provided data

### 2.2 Data Reporting
Bureaus:
- Receive data from furnishers monthly (typically)
- Store data per Metro 2 format
- Make data available to authorized parties
- Maintain consumer credit files

### 2.3 Consumer Report Generation
When a report is requested:
- Bureau compiles data from consumer's file
- Applies scoring algorithms
- Generates report for requestor
- Logs inquiry on consumer's file

## 3. BUREAU VERIFICATION RESPONSIBILITIES

### 3.1 What Bureaus Verify
| Bureau Verifies | Bureau Does NOT Verify |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Furnisher is reporting | Accuracy of original debt |
| Data format compliance | Consumer actually owes debt |
| Consumer identity match | Validity of creditor claims |
| Reporting timeline | Contract terms |
| Dispute processing | Original account agreement |

### 3.2 Investigation Limitations
Bureaus typically:
- Forward dispute to furnisher
- Accept furnisher's verification
- Compare data against what furnisher reports
- Do NOT conduct independent investigation
- Do NOT review original documents

### 3.3 This Is Important Because:
- Bureau "verification" means furnisher confirmed
- Does NOT mean independent fact-checking
- Consumer may need to dispute with furnisher directly
- Multiple dispute rounds may be necessary

---

## 4. FURNISHER VERIFICATION RESPONSIBILITIES

### 4.1 What Furnishers Must Verify
- Accuracy of reported information
- Consumer identity
- Account ownership
- Balance accuracy
