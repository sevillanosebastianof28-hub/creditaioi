## 1. HOW CREDIT SCORING WORKS

### 1.1 What is a Credit Score?
A credit score is a three-digit number that represents your creditworthiness based on your credit history. Lenders use this score to assess the risk of lending money to you.

### 1.2 Score Ranges
| Range | Rating | Typical Impact |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 800-850 | Excellent | Best rates and terms |
| 740-799 | Very Good | Good rates and terms |
| 670-739 | Good | Standard rates |
| 580-669 | Fair | Higher rates, may need collateral |
| 300-579 | Poor | Limited options, high rates |

### 1.3 FICO vs VantageScore
**FICO Score:**
- Created by Fair Isaac Corporation
- Used by 90% of top lenders
- Multiple versions (FICO 8, FICO 9, etc.)
- Range: 300-850

**VantageScore:**
- Created by the three credit bureaus
- Growing in adoption
- Currently on VantageScore 4.0
- Range: 300-850

## 2. THE FIVE SCORING FACTORS

### 2.1 Payment History (35%)
**What it measures:** Whether you pay bills on time
**Impact:** Single most important factor

**What helps:**
- Paying all bills on time
- Bringing past-due accounts current
- Time since late payments (older = less impact)

**What hurts:**
- Late payments (30, 60, 90+ days)
- Collections and charge-offs
- Bankruptcies and foreclosures

### 2.2 Credit Utilization (30%)
**What it measures:** How much credit you're using vs. available
**Calculation:** (Total balances ÷ Total credit limits) × 100

**Optimal utilization:** Under 30% (under 10% is even better)

**What helps:**
- Low balances relative to limits
- Paying down balances before statement closes
- Higher credit limits (with same spending)

**What hurts:**
- High balances relative to limits
- Maxed-out cards
- Closing cards (reduces available credit)

### 2.3 Length of Credit History (15%)
**What it measures:** How long you've had credit

**Factors considered:**
- Age of oldest account
- Age of newest account
- Average age of all accounts

**What helps:**
- Keeping old accounts open
- Not opening too many new accounts
- Time (length naturally increases)

**What hurts:**
- Closing old accounts
- Opening many new accounts (lowers average age)

### 2.4 Credit Mix (10%)
**What it measures:** Variety of credit types you manage

**Types of credit:**
- Revolving (credit cards, lines of credit)
- Installment (auto loans, mortgages, personal loans)
- Open (utilities, some cards)

**What helps:**
- Having multiple types of credit
- Responsibly managing different account types

**Note:** Don't open accounts just for mix - only helps marginally

### 2.5 New Credit/Inquiries (10%)
**What it measures:** Recent credit-seeking activity

**What's counted:**
- Hard inquiries (credit applications)
- Newly opened accounts

**What helps:**
- Limiting credit applications
- Rate shopping in short window (counts as one inquiry)

**What hurts:**
- Many applications in short time
- Opening several accounts quickly

## 3. WHAT DISPUTES CAN AND CANNOT DO

### 3.1 What Disputes CAN Do
✅ Remove inaccurate negative information
✅ Correct errors in reporting
✅ Update outdated information
✅ Remove accounts past reporting limit
✅ Remove unauthorized inquiries
✅ Fix identity mix-ups

### 3.2 What Disputes CANNOT Do
❌ Remove accurate negative information
❌ Guarantee any specific outcome
❌ Instantly improve credit score
❌ Bypass legitimate credit history
❌ Create positive history that doesn't exist
❌ Remove accurate debts you owe

### 3.3 Important Understanding
**Disputes are about accuracy, not about whether information is negative.**

An accurate late payment from last year will likely remain on your report even after dispute. A late payment from 8 years ago should be removed because it's past the reporting limit.

## 4. REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS

### 4.1 Timeline Expectations
| Action | Typical Timeline |
|--------|------------------|
| Dispute investigation | 30-45 days |
| Score update after deletion | 30-60 days |
| Late payment impact fade | 12-24 months |
| Negative item aging off | 7 years |
| Credit building | 6-12 months minimum |

### 4.2 Score Impact Expectations
- No single action "adds" a specific number of points
- Impact depends on overall credit profile
- Thin files see more dramatic changes
- Thick files see more moderate changes
- Scores fluctuate naturally month to month

### 4.3 What Success Looks Like
**Realistic success:**
- Removal of items that are genuinely inaccurate
- Gradual score improvement over time
- Better understanding of your credit
- Fewer errors on your reports

**Unrealistic expectations:**
- All negative items removed
- 100+ point improvement overnight
- Perfect credit score immediately
- Never having a dispute verified
