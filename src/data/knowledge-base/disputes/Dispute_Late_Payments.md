✅ **Payment was made on time**
- Have proof of payment before due date
- Payment posted late due to creditor error
- Payment was applied to wrong account

✅ **Late payment severity is wrong**
- Shows 60 days late when was only 30
- Shows 90 days late when was less
- Severity code doesn't match actual delinquency

✅ **Date of late payment is wrong**
- Month/year incorrect
- Shows late payment in wrong billing cycle
- Multiple late payments when only one occurred

✅ **Account was current during reported late period**
- Was on payment plan and compliant
- Had deferment or forbearance
- Payment arrangement in place

✅ **Late payment reported on closed account after payoff**
- Account shows late after settlement
- Continued reporting after paid in full

✅ **Duplicate late payment reporting**

## 2. WHEN DISPUTE IS NOT ALLOWED

### 2.1 Ineligible Dispute Scenarios
❌ **Late payment is accurate**
- Payment genuinely made after due date
- No creditor error or special circumstance
- Records confirm delinquency

❌ **Dispute based on hardship alone**
- "I was going through a hard time"
- Financial difficulty doesn't make reporting inaccurate
- May be eligible for goodwill request instead

❌ **Grace period confusion**
- Many cards have grace periods for interest, not reporting
- Late payment after due date is reportable
- Grace period doesn't extend due date

❌ **Disputing to improve score**
- Accurate late payments can be reported for 7 years
- Impact on score is not grounds for dispute

## 3. RISK INDICATORS

### 3.1 High Risk (Extra Verification Needed)
⚠️ Consumer claims all late payments are wrong
⚠️ Consumer has pattern of late payments across accounts
⚠️ No documentation available
⚠️ Creditor has clear records of delinquency
⚠️ Consumer previously agreed late payment occurred

### 3.2 Fraud Risk Indicators
🚨 Consumer wants to dispute all payment history
🚨 Consumer admits payments were late but wants removal
🚨 Using template language suggesting scheme

---

## 4. REQUIRED EVIDENCE

### 4.1 For "Paid On Time" Disputes
- Bank statement showing payment clearing before due date
- Confirmation number or receipt from payment
- Credit card statement showing payment posted
- Check images with dates

### 4.2 For Severity Disputes
- Payment history from creditor
- Credit report showing conflicting information
- Documentation of when payment was made

### 4.3 For Accommodation Disputes
- Documentation of payment plan agreement
- Forbearance or deferment letter
- Disaster declaration documentation
- CARES Act acknowledgment

### 4.4 For Goodwill Requests (Not Disputes)
- Explanation of circumstances
- Proof of otherwise good payment history
- Evidence of hardship (medical bills, job loss letter)

## 5. EXPECTED BUREAU RESPONSE TYPES

### 5.1 Possible Outcomes
| Response | Meaning | Next Steps |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Deleted | Late payment removed | Success - monitor |
| Updated | Severity or date changed | Verify correction |
| Verified | Creditor confirmed late payment | Consider goodwill or escalation |
| Modified | Partial correction made | Review for completeness |

### 5.2 Verified Response Analysis
When late payment is verified:
- Creditor has records supporting late payment
- May still pursue goodwill adjustment
- Consider if evidence was properly reviewed
- Evaluate escalation options

---

## 6. ESCALATION RULES

### 6.1 When to Escalate
Escalation appropriate when:
- Have evidence payment was on time
- Evidence not considered in first dispute
- Creditor has history of reporting errors
- Accommodation was in place

### 6.2 Escalation Path
1. **Round 1**: Bureau dispute with documentation
2. **Round 2**: Direct creditor dispute + bureau escalation
3. **Round 3**: Executive customer service contact
4. **Round 4**: CFPB complaint if evidence supports
5. **Alternative**: Goodwill request to creditor

### 6.3 Escalation NOT Appropriate
- Late payment was accurate
- No new evidence available
- Previous escalation addressed issue
- Consumer admits payment was late

---

## 7. COMPLIANCE WARNINGS

### 7.1 Credit AI Must
- ✅ Distinguish between disputes and goodwill requests
- ✅ Require evidence for inaccuracy claims
- ✅ Explain 7-year reporting period
- ✅ Be clear about realistic outcomes
- ✅ Suggest goodwill when dispute inappropriate

### 7.2 Credit AI Must NOT
- ❌ Suggest disputing known-accurate late payments
- ❌ Guarantee late payment removal
- ❌ Imply all late payments are removable
- ❌ Confuse disputes with goodwill requests
- ❌ Promise creditor will grant goodwill

### 7.3 Required Disclaimers
> "Late payment disputes require evidence of inaccuracy. Accurately reported late payments may remain on your report for up to 7 years. Goodwill requests are at the creditor's discretion."

## 8. GOODWILL REQUEST GUIDANCE

### 8.1 When Goodwill is Appropriate
- Late payment is accurate but:
  - Isolated incident in otherwise good history
  - Caused by documented hardship
  - Consumer has since maintained good standing
  - Consumer is otherwise loyal customer

### 8.2 Goodwill Request Elements
- Acknowledge the late payment occurred
- Explain circumstances (briefly)
- Highlight positive relationship with creditor
- Request removal as gesture of goodwill
- Remain polite and non-demanding

### 8.3 Goodwill Expectations
- No guarantee of success
- Creditors have no obligation
- Some creditors have strict policies
- Multiple late payments less likely successful
- Recent customers less likely successful

## 9. STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 9.1 For Single Late Payments
1. Gather payment documentation
2. Determine if dispute or goodwill appropriate
3. Start with bureau dispute if evidence supports
4. Follow with goodwill if dispute verified

### 9.2 For Multiple Late Payments (Same Creditor)
1. Review pattern - are all inaccurate?
2. Dispute specific inaccuracies only
3. Consider payment history overall
4. Goodwill unlikely for pattern

### 9.3 For Old Late Payments (5+ years)
1. Verify accurate reporting period
2. Less impact on current score
3. May not be worth dispute effort
4. Will age off naturally
