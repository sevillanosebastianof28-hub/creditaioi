**Last Updated: 2025-01-29**
**Account Type: Charge-Off**

---

## 1. WHEN DISPUTE IS ALLOWED

### 1.1 Eligible Dispute Scenarios
✅ **Date of First Delinquency (DOFD) is incorrect**
- DOFD shows charge-off date instead of first delinquency
- DOFD has been re-aged
- DOFD differs between bureaus

✅ **Balance is inaccurate**
- Shows balance when settled
- Includes unauthorized fees/interest
- Doesn't reflect payments made
- Differs significantly between bureaus

✅ **Account is past 7-year reporting limit**
- More than 7 years from true DOFD
- Still appearing when should have aged off

✅ **Status doesn't reflect current state**
- Paid charge-off shows unpaid
- Settled shows as unpaid balance
- Discharged in bankruptcy but shows owed

✅ **Not your account**
- Identity theft
- Mixed file
- Authorized user incorrectly shown as primary

✅ **Duplicate reporting**
- Charge-off AND collection for same debt
- Multiple charge-offs for same account

✅ **Account type incorrectly reported**
- Wrong account type classification
- Affects credit mix unfairly

## 2. WHEN DISPUTE IS NOT ALLOWED

### 2.1 Ineligible Dispute Scenarios
❌ **Accurate charge-off within reporting period**
- Account was charged off
- DOFD is accurate
- Balance is correct
- Within 7-year window

❌ **Disputing because of negative impact**
- Charge-offs hurt scores, but accurate info is reportable
- Impact is not grounds for dispute

❌ **Disputing valid debt you stopped paying**
- Failure to pay doesn't make reporting inaccurate
- Account correctly reflects what happened

## 3. RISK INDICATORS

### 3.1 High Risk (Extra Verification Needed)
⚠️ Consumer claims charge-off isn't theirs but has payment history
⚠️ Consumer opened other accounts with same creditor
⚠️ Charge-off amount matches consumer's credit limit
⚠️ Consumer previously acknowledged debt
⚠️ Address/phone on account matches consumer

### 3.2 Fraud Risk Indicators
🚨 Consumer wants to dispute all charge-offs
🚨 Consumer admits they stopped paying
🚨 No specific inaccuracy identified
🚨 Using identical template language for all disputes

---

## 4. REQUIRED EVIDENCE

### 4.1 For DOFD Disputes
- Credit reports from all 3 bureaus showing different DOFDs
- Original creditor statements with payment history
- Documentation showing when account actually became delinquent

### 4.2 For Balance Disputes
- Settlement agreement showing $0 balance
- Payment confirmations
- Creditor statements post-settlement
- Bank records of settlement payment

### 4.3 For Status Disputes
- Settlement letter

## 5. EXPECTED BUREAU RESPONSE TYPES

### 5.1 Possible Outcomes
| Response | Meaning | Next Steps |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Deleted | Charge-off removed | Success - monitor |
| Updated | Information corrected | Verify all corrections made |
| Verified | Creditor confirmed accuracy | Evaluate escalation |
| Modified | Partial changes | Review what changed |

### 5.2 Understanding "Verified" Response
- Creditor confirmed information to bureau
- Does NOT mean thorough investigation occurred
- May warrant escalation with evidence
- Consider direct creditor dispute

---

## 6. ESCALATION RULES

### 6.1 When to Escalate
Escalation appropriate when:
- Have evidence of specific inaccuracy
- Bureau didn't consider provided evidence
- New information obtained
- Creditor failed to update after settlement

### 6.2 Escalation Path
1. **Round 1**: Standard bureau dispute
2. **Round 2**: Bureau dispute with documentation + direct creditor dispute
3. **Round 3**: Bureau escalation (executive offices)
4. **Round 4**: CFPB complaint if evidence supports

### 6.3 Escalation NOT Appropriate
- Charge-off is accurate
- No evidence of inaccuracy
- Disputing simply because it's negative
- Previous CFPB on same issue

---

## 7. COMPLIANCE WARNINGS

### 7.1 Credit AI Must
- ✅ Identify specific inaccuracies only
- ✅ Explain difference between DOFD and charge-off date
- ✅ Be clear about realistic outcomes
- ✅ Recommend documentation gathering
- ✅ Explain 7-year reporting rule

### 7.2 Credit AI Must NOT
- ❌ Promise charge-off removal
- ❌ Suggest disputing accurate charge-offs
- ❌ Imply charge-offs are easily removed
- ❌ Advise strategies to "make them go away"
- ❌ Guarantee score improvements

### 7.3 Required Disclaimers
> "Charge-off disputes require evidence of specific inaccuracies. Accurately reported charge-offs may remain for 7 years from the date of first delinquency. Results cannot be guaranteed."

## 8. STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 8.1 For Recent Charge-Offs (< 2 years)
1. Document DOFD immediately
2. Compare across all 3 bureaus
3. Identify specific inaccuracies
4. Consider negotiating update if paying
5. Request "paid charge-off" status if settling

### 8.2 For Older Charge-Offs (2-5 years)
1. Verify DOFD hasn't been changed
2. Check for reporting limit violations
3. Confirm balance is accurate
4. Look for duplicate reporting with collections

### 8.3 For Near-Limit Charge-Offs (6-7 years)
1. Calculate exact 7-year date from DOFD
2. Document if past limit
3. Dispute if beyond 7 years
4. Monitor for automatic aging off

### 8.4 For Paid/Settled Charge-Offs
1. Confirm status reflects payment
2. Verify balance shows $0 or settlement amount
3. Dispute if still showing balance owed
4. Keep settlement documentation indefinitely

## 9. CHARGE-OFF VS COLLECTION

### 9.1 Key Differences
| Factor | Charge-Off | Collection |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Who Reports | Original Creditor | Collection Agency |
| Account Type | Original account | Separate tradeline |
| DOFD | From original account | Same as original |
| Reporting Period | 7 years from DOFD | 7 years from original DOFD |

### 9.2 Duplicate Reporting Issues
Both should NOT report:
- Full balance on both
- Same account as two tradelines with balances

Both CAN report:
- Charge-off with $0 balance + collection with balance
- Or charge-off transferred to collections

### 9.3 What to Dispute
- If both show balance, one should be $0
- DOFD should match on both
- Only one should show as "owed"
