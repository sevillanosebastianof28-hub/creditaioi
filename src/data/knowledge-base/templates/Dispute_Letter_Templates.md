Re: Dispute of Date of First Delinquency
    SSN: XXX-XX-[LAST 4]
    DOB: [DATE OF BIRTH]

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to dispute the Date of First Delinquency (DOFD) reported for the following account. Under FCRA Section 605(a), the 7-year reporting period begins from the Date of First Delinquency. I believe this date has been inaccurately reported.

DISPUTED ITEM:
Creditor Name: [CREDITOR NAME]
Account Number: [ACCOUNT NUMBER]
Reported DOFD: [DATE SHOWN]

DISPUTE REASON:
The Date of First Delinquency reported appears to be inaccurate. [CHOOSE ONE:]

□ My records indicate the actual DOFD should be [CORRECT DATE], which would mean this account has exceeded the 7-year reporting period.

□ The DOFD differs across credit bureaus, indicating an error in reporting.

□ This date appears to have been changed from a previous report, which may constitute re-aging in violation of FCRA.

I request that you investigate this matter and verify the accurate Date of First Delinquency. If the DOFD cannot be verified, or if it is confirmed to be beyond the 7-year reporting limit, please delete this account from my credit file.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
